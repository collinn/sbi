## Introduction to Sampling

Suppose policy makers and public health experts in Iowa are concerned with Iowans' fast food intake. To understand this further, officials want to determine the average monthly spending on fast food for all Iowans. It would be very expensive, however, to have all 3.2 million Iowans track and report their total monthly fast food expenses. Whatsmore, many Iowans would not be willing to share personal financial details with public health researchers or government officials. These are but a few of the challenges making it practically impossible for officials to ever determine the true average spent by Iowans each month on fast food. 

A true numeric quantity about the population, here assumed to be the mean, is known as a **population parameter**. While we may never know the exact value of a population parameter, we have tools at our disposal to estimate it. For example, officials can determine a *representative sample* of Iowans and have those consenting to share their information report their monthly fast food spending. The average spending of this group is the *sample mean*, which can then be used approximate the population mean. The sample mean is an example of a **sample statistic**, which is a numerical quantity about the sample. In other words, statistics are what investigators know, and parameters are what investigators want to know. 

The statistical framework (pictured below) demonstrates the process of making **inference** about population parameters with the use of sample statistics, as was done in the example above. The numerical quantities of interest can be many different things -- means, proportions, standard deviations, etc.,. While the methods of estimation are similar in each case, the present chapter will focus specifically on estimations of the mean. (maybe mention here that this is general discussion with mathematical derivations saved for a later chapter)

        \end{tikzpicture}
```


The statistical framework outlines the general process of making inference using sample statistics to estimate population parameters. In trying to make proper inference, we want to ensure our that our calculated statistic is a valid estimate of the population parameter of interest. To that end, there are two major statistical issues we concern ourselves with: 

* On average, does our estimate tend to be centered around the true answer, or is it *biased*?  
* How much *variability* is there likely to be in our sample? 

The difference between our estimate and our parameter is called **bias**. **Variance** (or "noise") is a description of the spread of our data. Sometimes we talk about spread in terms of **precision**, which is the reciprocal of variance. The more precision we have, the less variance, and vice-versa. A good statistic will have little or no bias and would have minimal variability. We can visualize both bias and variability using a dart board analogy:

```{r image-ref-for-in-text2, fig.align ='center', fig.cap='Bias and Variability Illustration', fig.pos='H', message = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=9}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/biasVariabilityTargets2.png")
```

In terms of priority, having a low bias is generally more desirable than low variance, and this is represented in the top row above. Having low bias indicates that our sample statistic is correctly estimating the population parameter of interest, even if our statistic is considered "noisy". Variance, illustrated in the columns, gives an idea of how "consistent" our estimate is. One way to think of it is to consider the throwing of a dart to the collection of a sample; comparing the top right and bottom left corners, we might say it is better throw generally close to the target than to consistently miss it entirely. Statisticians work hard to develop sampling and inferential procedures that allow us to estimate population parameters with low variability and little to no bias.

## Sampling Distributions 

In order to make inference, we must be able to quantify our uncertainty about the population parameter based on our sample data. To illustrate this uncertainty, consider again our example above in estimating the average expenditures of Iowans on fast food, and suppose that researchers decide to sample 500 individuals from the population and calculate the sample mean, $\overline{x}$. Now suppose that those same researchers go out and collect a *second* sample of 500 individuals from the population and calculate the sample mean again, which me might call $\overline{x}_2$. Should we expect $\overline{x}$ and $\overline{x}_2$ to be exactly the same? What if they did this again and calculated $\overline{x}_3$? Or $\overline{x}_4$?

As we might expect, it is very unlikely that any of these will be exactly equal to any of the others, though they might be close. But if none of these sample means are equal to each other, how accurate might we expect any of them to be with regards to estimating our population parameter? Herein lies the question of quantifying our uncertainty. Fortunately, statisticians have created powerful methods for being able to do so accurately, even when only a single sample statistic has been obtained.

We might first begin by recognizing that the process of sampling from a population is itself a *random experiment*, with the sample mean $\overline{x}$ being a numeric quantity which assumes a value based on the outcome of that experiment. This should sound familiar -- this is precisely the definition of a random variable! Just as with other random variables, sample statistics themselves also follow a probability distribution. When the random variable itself is a statistic, we call the probability distribution a **sampling distribution**. Sampling distributions reflect which values of the statistic are likely if we were to repeat the sampling process (that is, likely values for $\overline{x}_2$, $\overline{x}_3$, etc.,), and which values are improbable. We might then expect that the value of the true population parameter will fall somewhere within the range of likely values. [[As we will see later in this chapter, this uncertainty depends on the number of individuals sampled and the variability of the data we measure.]]

The applet below is designed to help you get familiar with the concept of random sampling. The plot on the left side gives a population distribution consisting of 25 people, where each subject in the population is represented by one box. The x-axis represents the value of the outcome variable for each individual, with stacked boxes indicating that multiple people have the same value. For example, we have one subject in the population with a value of zero, three subjects with values of one, and so on. 

The plot on the right displays values for the subjects collected in our random sample, with the same subjects being highlighted in green on the left. We can take samples from our population of various sizes by changing the value of the slider at the top and clicking on the "Sample" button.

Following the conventions used previously, we will use upper-case letters to denote random variables and lower-case letters to denote values that have been observed (that is, they are no longer random). Regarding the sampling distribution of the mean, $\overline{X}$ represents the random variable which arises from the repeated random sampling from the population, while $\overline{x}$ represents an *observed* sample mean from an already collected sample.

In describing the sampling distribution, we are often interested in the mean and the standard deviation which, together, describe the size of the interval of probable values for our population parameter. When describing statistics with a sampling distribution, we refer to the sample mean as the **expected value** of our statistic, while the standard deviation is referred to as the **standard error**. For the random variable describing the sample mean, these are denoted as $E(\overline{X})$ and $SE(\overline{X}) = \sqrt{Var(\overline{X})}$, respectively.


Let's return to the fast food scenario to motivate our development, but for now let's assume there are only five individuals in the entire population. The monthly spending for those five individuals (rounded to the nearest dollar) is as follows:

```{r, echo = F}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(scales)
person <- c('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E')
monthlySpending <- c(8, 22, 22, 36, 50)
avgSpending <- mean(monthlySpending)
dat <- cbind(Person = person, 'Monthly Spending'= monthlySpending)
popSize <- length(person)
sampSize <- 3
nSamples <- choose(popSize, sampSize)
kable(dat) |> kable_styling(full_width=FALSE)
```


The population mean can be found by taking the average monthly spending of these five individuals, as they are the only people in this population. This means the population mean is `r avgSpending`. Now suppose we are taking samples of three individuals from this population. There are $\binom{5}{3}$ = `r nSamples` ways we can sample three people from this population. Since this is a small population, we can enumerate all possible samples, the values we would obtain for the monthly spending in each sample, and then the sample mean monthly fast food spending for each sample:

```{r, warning=F, echo = F}
allComb <- t(combn(person, 3))
allCombP <- rep(NA, nrow(allComb))
valuesComb <- rep(NA, nrow(allComb))
meanComb <- rep(NA, nrow(allComb))
for (i in 1:nrow(allComb)) {
  allCombP[i] <- paste0('(',paste( allComb[i,], collapse = ', '), ')')
  valuesComb[i] <- paste0('(',paste( dat[dat[,1] %in% allComb[i,],2], collapse = ', '), ')')
  meanComb[i] <- mean(as.numeric(dat[dat[,1] %in% allComb[i,],2]))
}

combDat <- data.frame(Sample = allCombP,
                      Values = valuesComb,
                      'Sample mean'=round(meanComb, 2))
combDat <- combDat[order(combDat[,3]),]

# combine sample/values when sample mean is the same
dupMeans <- combDat[,3][duplicated(combDat[,3])]

combSamples <- NULL
combValues <- NULL

for (i in 1:nrow(combDat)) {
  if (combDat[i,3]%in% dupMeans) {
    # which rows have same mean
    toComb <- which(combDat[,3] == combDat[i,3])
    combSamples <- c(combSamples,
                     paste(combDat[toComb,1], collapse = ', '))
    combValues <- c(combValues,
                     paste(combDat[toComb,2], collapse = ', '))
    
  } else {
    combSamples <- c(combSamples, combDat[i,1])
    combValues <- c(combValues, combDat[i,2])
  }
}

combDat2 <- data.frame(Sample = combSamples,
                      Values = combValues,
                      'Sample mean'=round(meanComb, 2))

toKeep <- which(!duplicated(combDat[,3]))
combDat2 <- combDat2[toKeep,]
kable(combDat2, row.names = F, col.names = c('Sample', 'Values', '$\\overline{x}$'), escape =F) |> kable_styling(full_width=FALSE)

```

One thing to note is that *none* of the sample means are actually equal to the population mean. This is often the case! Based on this table, we can construct the sampling distribution of $\overline{X}$ for a sample of size three.

::: {.infobox .think data-latex="thinkaboutit"}
Why is our sample mean often not equal to the population mean?
:::


```{r, echo = F}
countMeans <- table(round(meanComb, 2))
col1 <- paste0('P($\\overline{x}$ = ', names(countMeans), ')')
col2 <- prop.table(countMeans)
toPrint <- cbind(col1, col2)
expValue <- sum(as.numeric(names(countMeans))*col2)

kable(toPrint, col.names = c('', 'Probability'), row.names = F, escape = F) |> kable_styling(full_width=FALSE)
```

With this probability distribution, we can get the expected value of the sampling distribution. Whenever we think about probability, we are thinking about long-run frequencies, so when we think about the expected value, we are thinking about the average sample mean if we were to take repeated samples of size three from this population. The probability distribution indicates that if we took samples of size three from this population over and over again (say 1,000 times), we would end up with `r col2[1]*100`% with a mean of `r names(countMeans)[1]`, `r col2[2]*100`% with a mean of `r names(countMeans)[2]`, `r col2[3]*100`% with a mean of `r names(countMeans)[3]`; and so on. So the expected value (average) we would observed if we kept taking samples over and over would be:

(`r col2[1]` $\times$ `r names(countMeans)[1]`) + (`r col2[2]` $\times$ `r names(countMeans)[2]`)  + (`r col2[3]` $\times$ `r names(countMeans)[3]`)  + (`r col2[4]` $\times$ `r names(countMeans)[4]`) + (`r col2[5]` $\times$ `r names(countMeans)[5]`) =  `r expValue`

But wait! That *is* the population mean. This illustrates an extremely powerful property of the sample mean - the expected value of the sample mean $\overline{X}$ is equal to the population parameter $\mu$! Because of this, we say that the sample mean is an **unbiased estimator** of the population mean. While we illustrated the property with a small example, this holds regardless of the population or sample size.

## Central Limit Theorem

In the last section, we used a toy example to conceptualize repeated sampling and the property of the sample mean being an unbiased estimator. Now we will formalize these properties. For *any* population distribution which can be described by a random variable $X$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, the sample distribution of the mean based on sample of size $n$, denoted $\overline{X}_n$, has the following properties:  

1)  The expected value of the sampling distribution is $\mu$
$$E(\overline{X}_n) = \mu$$
2) The variance of the sampling distribution is
$$Var(\overline{X}_n) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$$

Together, these expressions are used to describe the typical value of the sample mean as well as the expected amount of variability in the sample mean under repeated sampling. From this, there are two further observations that are worth noting:

1) The expected value of the sample mean is always equal to $\mu$, regardless of the size of the sample: this property makes the sample mean an *unbiased* estimator of the population mean.

2) Whereas the expected value of the sample mean does not depend on $n$, the variance of the sampling distribution does. Indeed, this should match our intuition; as the size of our sample increases, the variability of $\overline{X}_n$ decreases, giving us a more precise estimate of the population mean.

As we've seen already, it is more common to discuss the standard deviation of a 
statistic than the variance. In the context of sampling distributions, this quantity 
is called the *standard error* (to emphasize that we are discussing a sampling 
distribution) and is denoted

$$SE(\overline{X}_n) = \sqrt{Var(\overline{X}_n)} = \sigma / \sqrt{n}$$

Note that while all standard errors could be referred to as standard deviations, 
the converse does not hold -- standard deviations not associated with a sampling
distribution are never referred to as standard errors. 

<!-- Using these formulas we are able to describe the typical value of the sample mean and how variable the sample mean is in repeated sampling. Notice that the expected value does not depend on the sample size, $n$, but the variance does. This means regardless of the sample size, the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. But, as the sample size increases, the variance decreases, and we get a more precise estimate of the population mean. As we've seen in the past, it is more common to talk about the standard deviation than the variance and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The quantity $\sqrt{Var(\overline{X}_n)} = \sigma / \sqrt{n}$ is primarily called the **standard error** of the mean, and is denoted by $SE(\overline{X}_n)$. We use the term standard error to make it really clear that it is referencing the sampling distribution of the mean, but all standard errors could be referred to as standard deviations. Conversely, not all standard deviations could be referred to as a standard error - the term is only used in describing the distribution of the sample mean. -->

Until now, we have discussed the mean and standard error of a random statistic
without having described the sampling *distribution* itself. Why might having
the distribution of a statistic be useful? Recall from the previous chapter that
we defined a distribution as a method of associating an event or outcome with 
its corresponding probability. As we shall see, the sample mean, along with 
its standard error, will help us in constructing a range of "likely" values 
that may contain the true parameter. With the use of a sampling distribution, 
we will now be able to assign a probability to the range of these likely values.

As it turns out, the process of randomly collecting a sample from a population 
and computing its sample means has a truly amazing property -- the sampling
distribution will always be normally distributed. This brings us to what is 
largely considered the "fundamental theorem of statistics". 


**Central Limit Theorem**

What the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states is this: so long as the size of our sample is "large enough", the sampling distribution of $\overline{X}$ will be approximately normal, regardless of the characteristics of the underlying distribution. That is, we have

$$\overline{X}_n \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2/n).$$

While the term "large enough" will inevitably depend on the context of the problem at hand, a typical rule of thumb puts this value at $n \geq 30$. Because the variance of $\overline{X}$ is inversely related to the sample size, as the $n$ increases, the variance decreases and the distribution becomes more concentrated around its mean value. This is one of the most important, remarkable, and powerful results in all of statistics. In the real world, we rarely know the underlying population distribution of our data, yet the CLT assures us that this is not an issue. In the next chapter, we will investigate how the consequences of the CLT create an immensely powerful tool in performing statistical inference.
