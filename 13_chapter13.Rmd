## What is a simulation? {#ch12_s1}

In the statistics world, when we use the word simulation we are not talking about 
*The Matrix* or *Westworld,* where humans exist in some simulated reality. Statistical simulations
use a computer to observe potential results of an experiments. Simulations can be used
for experiments as simple as flipping a coin or as complicated as investigating the dynamics of human
movement and interaction. One thing that all simulations have in common is the element
of **randomness**. If there was nothing random, the process would result in the same
outcome every time - like if someone offered me an all-expenses paid trip to Hawaii - the 
answer is always yes. This is what we call a **deterministic** outcome, and it is not
something where any statistical inference is needed. However, more often than not,
the phenomenon of interest is what we call **stochastic** which means there is
some element of randomness - like the weather in Hawaii during my trip - it might
be sunny, it might be rainy, and there is a tiny chance it might be below freezing.

Simulations allow us to specify the **parameters** that govern the scenario and then 
with the help of a computer, we can watch the scenario play out over and over. In the end,
this gives us an idea of all the likely outcomes *and* just how likely those outcomes might be.
Let's start with a simple example - flipping a coin
