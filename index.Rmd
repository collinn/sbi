# Introduction {-}

Welcome! This resource offers an interactive learning experience for introductory biostatistics. This resource was designed with the course BIOS:4120 Introduction to Biostatistics at the University of Iowa in mind, but could be used in any introductory statistics or biostatistics course. We combine textual explanations and embedded simulation-based Shiny applications, to provide students with an engaging learning resource that offers an intuitive illustration of core statistical concepts. The applications and associated exercises are targeted at *conceptional* understanding, as opposed to calculations.

At this point in time, we provide chapters on:

* Probability distributions (text and application)
* Sampling distributions and Central Limit Theorem  (text, applications, exercises)

All typos and errors contained within this text are intentional with the goal of keeping the reader vigilant
