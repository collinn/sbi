## Importance of Study Design {#ch3_s1}

In chapter 1, we defined statistics by its ability to quantify our uncertainty
about a potential outcome, e.g. the effectiveness of a drug. In order for us to 
effectively do this and make accurate inference, we must remove other sources of 
uncertainty. This is accomplished via high-quality study design and execution.
Despite statisticians best efforts, fancy statistical methods cannot save a poorly 
designed study. However, a well-designed study can make the statistics much simpler
and put researchers in the best position to answer their research questions and
advance science.

As a critical piece of the statistical framework, **study design** is the process that
allows us to collect data on the best sample from the population to achieve our research goals.
There are many types of study designs with various strengths and limitations. 
The entirety of the science of study design couldn't possible be covered in a 
single chapter of an introductory statistics textbook; instead we will focus on
some of the main considerations when designing a study, as well as the common
ways study design can go wrong and the statistical implications.

```{tikz statFramework3, fig.cap = "Statistical Framework", fig.ext = 'png', echo = F}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.pathreplacing,positioning, arrows, shapes, calc,shapes.multipart}
\tikzstyle{block1} = [rectangle, draw, fill=yellow!20, 
    text width=10em, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=6em]
\tikzstyle{block2} = [rectangle, draw, fill=yellow!20, 
    text width=5em, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=3em]
\tikzset{
    %Define standard arrow tip
    >=stealth,
    % Define arrow style
    pil/.style={
           ->,
           thick,
           shorten <=2pt,
           shorten >=2pt,}
}
\tikzstyle{line} = [draw, -latex]
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 3cm, auto]
            % Place nodes
            \node [block1] (pop) {Population};
            \node [block2, below of=pop] (samp) {Sample};
            
            % Draw edges
            \draw[->, >=latex, shorten >=2pt, shorten <=2pt, bend right=45, thick]  (pop.west) to node[auto, swap] {Study Design}(samp.west);
            \draw[->, >=latex, shorten >=2pt, shorten <=2pt, bend right=45, thick] (samp.east) to node[auto, swap] {Inference}(pop.east); 
            
        \end{tikzpicture}
```

In an ideal world, the study design process might look a little bit like this: 

1. We start with a list of everyone in our population of interest. 
2. Each person in this population is equally easy to sample, and the cost of sampling everyone is the same
3. We use our list to randomly select a proportion of individuals in the population who will participate in our study
4. Everybody sampled is eager to help us with our study, and nobody refuses to participate
5. The outcome of interest can be accurately measured on each subject and directly answers the research question.

Unfortunately, things are rarely perfect, and this can lead to what we call **bias**.
In our day to day life, we think about bias as some type of prejudice in favor or 
against a person or group. For example, if you are given two identical cupcakes 
and are told that one was made by a professional chef and the other was not, you 
may think that one cupcake tastes much better than the other one. Scientific or 
research bias is not all that different. We define scientific bias as the process 
or technique whereby the estimated outcome is systematically different from the
true value it is intended to estimate. As an over-the-top example, imagine you
were trying to estimate the percent of voters that will support the Democrat 
party in the next election. If you only asked voters who are registered 
Democrats, you would most certainly overestimate the actual percent you are
interested in. 

Bias can occur at various points during a research study and materialize
in many forms. The ability to identify bias is a crucial skill for researchers
to have when designing their own studies, as well as evaluating the merit of 
other studies in the literature. In this chapter, we focus on defining several
common types of bias, how each type can impact study results, and how they can
be avoided. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list - if you are interested in
learning about other types of bias, check out the [Catalogue of Biases](https://catalogofbias.org/biases/). We will categorize different types 
of bias broadly by when they occur: pre-trial, during trial, and 
post-trial. We will explore different types of bias in the context of a 
study on a newly developed vaccine seeking to prevent the spread of a novel
infectious pathogen.

## Pre-trial Bias {#ch3_s2}

### Selection Bias {#ch3_s2_ss1}

The first major consideration when planning a study is who you will ask
to participate. When selecting your sample, you must ensure the sample is 
representative of the population of interest. Otherwise, your study may be prone to
**selection bias**, where the study participants differ systematically from the
population of interest. In our hypothetical vaccine trial, there are many 
possible ways we could observe selection bias. In the first phase of a vaccine 
trial, the vaccine is often given to young, healthy volunteers to assess its safety 
profile. However, the vaccine is intended for use for both young and older people,
as well as those that may have underlying medical conditions. If the safety  of
the vaccine was only determined based on the initial studies in healthy 
participants, it would look safer than it really is. This is why these initial 
studies are primarily used to stop development of a vaccine that is unsafe.
Vaccines that are found to be safe in healthy people proceed to further 
testing in the general population to accurately determine the safety profile. 
Selection bias can be avoided by...


### Placebo Effect {#ch3_s2_ss2}

To determine if a new treatment is effective, it must be compared to something 
else. This is addressed by splitting the sample into two groups: the 
**treatment group** and the **control group**. Subjects in the treatment group
are given the vaccine, whereas subjects in the control group are not treated 
and are used for comparison. Subjects must be assigned to receive the treatment
or control at random to avoid selection bias. In addition, there is the potential
for bias to arise if the subjects know whether or not they're being treated.

**Selection Bias: ** <em> A type of bias in which subgroups of the population were more likely to be included than others </em>

**Treatment group: ** <em> The part of the sample that receives the treatment </em>

**Control Group: ** <em> The part of the sample that is not treated for comparison purposes </em>

**Observer Bias: ** <em> Bias arising when observers record subjective data </em>
  
**Confirmation Bias: ** <em> Any process or technique whereby the actual outcome is
  systematically different from the true value it is intended to estimate </em>

**Placebo Effect: ** <em> Any process or technique whereby the actual outcome is
  systematically different from the true value it is intended to estimate </em>
</div>


## During-trial Bias {#ch3_s3}


### Non-response Bias {#ch3_s3_ss1}

In the previous example, we noted that 10 million questionnaires had been sent out, but only 2.4 million responses were returned. While it would certainly be nice if everybody complied with our requests for information, it is often unrealistic to expect that each inquiry will be returned. In and of itself, this is not a problem. Indeed, so long as non-response is random and the samples collected continue to be representative of the population, our sample population will still be valid. However, what if non-response is not random? In other words, what happens if one sub-group of the population is more likely to respond to a survey than another? More specifically, **non-response bias** is the phenomenon in which willingness to respond to a survey (or selection) is related to the scientific question [[i don't like this paragraph at all]]



### Recall Bias {#ch3_s3_ss2}

### Measurement Bias {#ch3_s3_ss3}

### Observer Bias {#ch3_s3_ss4}

<div class="definition-container">
<div class="definition"> &nbsp; </div>

**Non-response Bias: ** <em> A type of bias in which non-responders differ in a 
  meaningful way from the resonders</em>

**Recall Bias: ** <em> Bias that occurs when study participants' memories are altered 
  according to the outcome of interest </em>

**Observer Bias: ** <em> Bias arising when observers record subjective data </em>

**Measurement Bias: ** <em> Bias arising when data on the outcome is systematically 
  inaccurate</em>  
</div>



## Post-trial Bias {#ch3_s4}

### Confounding {#ch3_s4_ss1}

A *confounder*, also known as a *lurking variable*, is a third variable which is related to both exposure and outcome. Because of this relationship, confounders distort the observed relationship between exposure and outcome.


### Extrapolation Bias {#ch3_s4_ss2}

The previous two examples demonstrated ways in which we might incorrectly move from a target population to a non-representative sample. This final case describes movement in the opposite direction: from a specified sample to a more general population. Nonetheless, the cause of the bias is the same.

The motivation here can be most readily illustrated by considering the issue of pharmaceutical trails and the use of children. For practical, ethical, and economic reasons, clinical trials usually only involve adults - indeed, only about 25% of drugs are subjected to pediatric studies. Physicians, however, are allowed to use any FDA-approved drug in any way that they think is beneficial are are not required to inform parents if the therapy has not been tested on children. 


### Publication Bias {#ch3_s4_ss3}
