## Statistics and Evidence-based Research {#ch1_s1}

Dr. Anne Ecdote bases all her decisions off things she's observed. Dr. Eva Dense 
bases her practice off well-researched studies. Dr. Opi Yon bases his practice
off his personal beliefs. You visit each doctor with a headache. Dr. Ecdote says
the last person she saw with a headache had a brain tumor, so you should 
probably get an MRI. Dr. Yon says headaches are a construct of our imagination 
and that if you would just stop thinking about it, it will go away. Dr. Dense
recommends a pain reliever that has been studied in several large clinical 
trials and repeatedly shown to be effective at reducing headaches. Which doctor 
would you listen to?

There are many definitions of statistics: 

* the science of learning from experiences
* the study of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data
* the mathematics of uncertainty
* a required college course designed to make everyone miserable

All of these definitions hold some truth (some more than others - we'll let you 
guess which `r emo::ji("wink")`). Statistics is a highly interdisciplinary field, with methods 
applicable to and used by a wide variety of disciplines. The importance of the
field of statistics lies in it's ability to quantify our uncertainty about a 
potential outcome - such as the most likely cause and treatment for a headache.
Almost everything in life is associated with some uncertainty - the weather, 
your career, the connection between your genetics and your response to certain
medications. However, just because something isn't known with 100% certainty, 
doesn't mean we can't understand it better. Statistics helps us understand the 
world better by allowing us to measure our uncertainty, describe associations 
between phenomena, and make informed decisions.

And how exactly do researchers use statistics to quantify their uncertainty? 
Well, this is achieved by collecting data, or evidence, about whatever process
is of interest. For example, if you want to know how likely it is to rain 
tomorrow, you might look at the weather in your location the past few days.
Since rain can travel, you might also look at the past weather in the surrounding
areas. You could also evaluate historical weather records to determine if
this season is known for being particularly rainy or dry in the past. These are
all various examples of data you can collect to inform your weather prediction.
In scientific research, data is obtained and investigated through statistical
inquiry to help answer important questions: 

* Which drug should a doctor prescribe to treat an illness?  
* Can we predict the longevity of the national population to inform government decisions regarding Social Security?  
* What factors increase the risk of an individual developing coronary heart disease?  

These questions are too important to be left to opinion, superstition, and 
conjecture. Thus, there has been a tremendous push for objective, 
*evidence-based* decision making in medicine, public health, and policy making. 
Statistics and biostatistics are the sciences that allows us to mSake these 
decisions. When studying humans, we can't control every aspect of their life, 
such as what they eat or where they work. There are ethical considerations - if 
we wanted to research the effects of smoking on lung cancer, we would not be 
able to force people to smoke (or not). Humans are also incredibly diverse and 
variable, not to mention expensive to perform research upon. Despite these 
issues, there is a moral imperative to make decisions on potentially life-saving
therapies as fast as possible. To make evidence-based conclusions, we need to 
collect, process, analyze, and interpret data in order to draw conclusions in an 
objective manner. 

## Scientific Method {#ch1_s2}

In principle, people collect and process information every day of their lives. 
Since it's something we do frequently, you might think we would be really good 
at it...but we're not. Unfortunately, humans are not natural statisticians. We 
are not good at picking out patterns from a sea of noisy data. And, on the flip 
side, we are *too good* at picking out non-existent patterns from small numbers 
of observations. We also find it difficult to sort out the effects of multiple
factors occurring simultaneously and we are subject to all sorts of biases 
depending on our personalities, emotions, and past experiences.

Some examples of these would be good.

The **scientific method** is the process used to answer scientific questions.
 
1) Ask a question
2) Do background research
3) Construct a hypothesis
4) Test your hypothesis with a study or an experiment
5) Analyze data and draw conclusions
6) How do the results align with your hypothesis?
7) Communicate results





## Statistical framework {#ch1_s4}

There are three basic questions in statistics:  

1) How should I collect my data?  
2) How should I describe and summarize the data I've collected?
3) What does my data tell me about the way the world works?  

Throughout the book, we will cover different ways of analyzing data and making conclusions about the way the world works. Depending on the type of data, there are different methods of analysis.


In general, scientists use the scientific method to make generalizations about classes of people on the basis of their studies. The class of people that they are trying to make generalizations about is called the **population**. Most of the time, it is impratical and expensive to study all individuals in a population - although the United States government does do the best they can every 10 years. Instead of sampling everyone in the population, or taking a **census**, typically we study only a portion of th the population called the **sample**. In order to determine how best to obtain a sample to answer the research questions, we must be cautious about the **study design**. Then, researchers make generalizations, or **inference**, about the entire population based on studying the sample. We can visualize the statistical framework using this diagram:

            \draw[->, >=latex, shorten >=2pt, shorten <=2pt, bend right=45, thick]  (pop.west) to node[auto, swap] {Study Design}(samp.west);
            \draw[->, >=latex, shorten >=2pt, shorten <=2pt, bend right=45, thick] (samp.east) to node[auto, swap] {Inference}(pop.east);
