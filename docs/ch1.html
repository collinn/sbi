<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Statistics and Evidence-based Research</h2>
<p>Dr. Anne Ecdote bases all her decisions off things she’s observed. Dr. Eva Dense
bases her practice off well-researched studies. Dr. Opi Yon bases his practice
off his personal beliefs. You visit each doctor with a headache. Dr. Ecdote says
the last person she saw with a headache had a brain tumor, so you should
probably get an MRI. Dr. Yon says headaches are a construct of our imagination
and that if you would just stop thinking about it, it will go away. Dr. Dense
recommends a pain reliever that has been studied in several large clinical
trials and repeatedly shown to be effective at reducing headaches. Which doctor
would you listen to?</p>
<p>There are many definitions of statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>the science of learning from experiences</li>
<li>the study of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data</li>
<li>the mathematics of uncertainty</li>
<li>a required college course designed to make everyone miserable</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these definitions hold some truth (some more than others - we’ll let you
guess which 😉). Statistics is a highly interdisciplinary field, with methods
applicable to and used by a wide variety of disciplines. The importance of the
field of statistics lies in it’s ability to quantify our uncertainty about a
potential outcome - such as the most likely cause and treatment for a headache.
Almost everything in life is associated with some uncertainty - the weather,
your career, the connection between your genetics and your response to certain
medications. However, just because something isn’t known with 100% certainty,
doesn’t mean we can’t understand it better. Statistics helps us understand the
world better by allowing us to measure our uncertainty, describe associations
between phenomena, and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>And how exactly do researchers use statistics to quantify their uncertainty?
Well, this is achieved by collecting data, or evidence, about whatever process
is of interest. For example, if you want to know how likely it is to rain
tomorrow, you might look at the weather in your location the past few days.
Since rain can travel, you might also look at the past weather in the surrounding
areas. You could also evaluate historical weather records to determine if
this season is known for being particularly rainy or dry in the past. These are
all various examples of data you can collect to inform your weather prediction.
In scientific research, data is obtained and investigated through statistical
inquiry to help answer important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which drug should a doctor prescribe to treat an illness?<br />
</li>
<li>Can we predict the longevity of the national population to inform government decisions regarding Social Security?<br />
</li>
<li>What factors increase the risk of an individual developing coronary heart disease?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are too important to be left to opinion, superstition, and
conjecture. Thus, there has been a tremendous push for objective,
<strong>evidence-based</strong> decision making in medicine, public health, and policy making.
Statistics and biostatistics are the sciences that allows us to mSake these
decisions. When studying humans, we can’t control every aspect of their life,
such as what they eat or where they work. There are ethical considerations - if
we wanted to research the effects of smoking on lung cancer, we would not be
able to force people to smoke (or not). Humans are also incredibly diverse and
variable, not to mention expensive to perform research upon. Despite these
issues, there is a moral imperative to make decisions on potentially life-saving
therapies as fast as possible. To make evidence-based conclusions, we need to
collect, process, analyze, and interpret data in order to draw conclusions in an
objective manner.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Scientific Method</h2>
<p>In principle, people collect and process information every day of their lives.
Since it’s something we do frequently, you might think we would be really good
at it…but we’re not. Unfortunately, humans are not natural statisticians. We
are not good at picking out patterns from a sea of noisy data. And, on the flip
side, we are <em>too good</em> at picking out non-existent patterns from small numbers
of observations. We also find it difficult to sort out the effects of multiple
factors occurring simultaneously and we are subject to all sorts of biases
depending on our personalities, emotions, and past experiences.</p>
<p>In order to mitigate any of our own personal biases when answering important
questions about the way the world works (i.e., to do good science), we must be
careful to be rigorous in the way we proceed. The <strong>scientific method</strong> is the
process used to answer scientific questions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ask a question</li>
<li>Construct a hypothesis</li>
<li>Test your hypothesis with a study or an experiment</li>
<li>Analyze data and draw conclusions</li>
<li>Communicate results</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example of the scientific method, consider that you would like to start a
garden, but you are not sure which type of fertilizer is best. If there are three
types of fertilizer you cannot decided between, you might proceed through the
scientific method as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ask a question</li>
</ol>
<p>Of fertilizers A, B, and C, which will yield the fastest plant growth in my garden?</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Construct a hypothesis</li>
</ol>
<p>You may have read some reviews for each type of fertilizer online. Fertilizer A
has 4.5 stars, fertilizer B as 4.2 stars, and fertilizer C has 4.6 stars. Thus,
you may hypothesize that fertilizer C leads to the fastest plant growth, followed
by fertilizer A, and that fertilizer B has the slowest plant growth.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Test your hypothesis with a study or an experiment</li>
</ol>
<p>To test your hypothesis, you can section off three areas of your garden. In each
area, you use one of the three fertilizers and plant the same number and type of
plants. In order for your experiment to be fair, you will want to make sure each
of the three areas is equal-size, gets the same amount of sunlight, is watered
the same amount, etc.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Analyze data and draw conclusions</li>
</ol>
<p>After 5 weeks, you measure the height of each plant which use each type of
fertilizer. Taking the average plant height from each of the three sections of
your garden, you find that when fertilizer A was used, the average plant height
was the tallest and thus you conclude that fertilizer A is the best for your
garden.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Communicate results</li>
</ol>
<p>Other gardeners in your area may be interested in your results. You may share
with them your recommendation for fertilizer A, which is backed by a
well-controlled experiment.</p>
<p>Even in this relatively simple example, you can see how much care is required to
have a valid experiment. There are many other factors that may also influence
your decision on the best fertilizer, such as the price and availability. It’s
also possible that fertilizer A ended up with the fastest average plant growth
just due to random chance, and if you repeated the entire experiment again you
might find fertilizer B or C to result in taller plants.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Statistical framework</h2>
<p>As we saw in the fertilizer example, collecting and analyzing data can be complicated.
Statistics helps us design studies, test hypotheses, and use data to make scientifically
valid conclusions about the world. In general, scientists use the scientific method
to make generalizations about classes of people on the basis of their studies.
The class of people that they are trying to make generalizations about is called
the <strong>population</strong>. Most of the time, it is impractical and expensive to study
all individuals in a population - although many governments do the best they
can every 10 years. Instead of sampling everyone in the population, or taking a
<strong>census</strong>, typically we study only a portion of the population called the
<strong>sample</strong>. In order to determine how best to obtain a sample to answer the
research questions, we must be cautious about the <strong>study design</strong>. Then,
researchers make generalizations, or <strong>inference</strong>, about the entire population
based on studying the sample. We can visualize the statistical framework using
this diagram:</p>

<p>Throughout this book, we will dive deeper in to each aspect of the statistical
framework. We consider two broad categories of statistical
analysis: <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>, which deals with methods for summarizing
and/or presenting data and <strong>inferential statistics</strong>.</p>
