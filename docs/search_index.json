In the previous chapter, we introduced the idea of random processes, which are situations where the outcome can not be determined perfectly in advance. We encounter random processes all the time in our lives, from the exact amount of time it takes to get to class from your home, to determining the winner of a football game. In any case, the random process is defined in terms of the collection of possible events and their associated probabilities. While the number of unique outcomes of a random process may be impossible to count, we will find that many of them have a very similar underlying structure dictating how these events occur. Formally recognizing the properties of these structures, as well as understanding how they can be used to make predictions, motivates the goals of this chapter. 1.1 Introduction to Probability Distributions Most simply, a probability distribution (often just called a distribution) is a method for taking a possible event as input, and giving us the corresponding probability as output. The corresponding probability tells us how likely it is that the specific event will occur, out of all of the possible events. A helpful metaphor is to consider a machine that produces these events at random frequencies corresponding to their associated probabilities. That is, if our machine only creates green marbles and red marbles, and the probability of producing a green marble is 75%, then on average, our machine will make 3 green marbles for each red one. In this sense, we can think of distributions as “data generating mechanisms” - the distributions govern how the machine which generates data works. To continue with the machine metaphor, it will be important for us to distinguish between two machines that are completely different, and two machines that are the same but tuned to different settings. These settings, which we call distribution parameters, dictate many aspects of how the machine will generate data, including the range of likely events, how likely these events are to occur, and how much variability we might expect in the events that we observe. To briefly illustrate, we might first consider a normal distribution, which is governed by two parameters: the mean value, \\(\\mu\\), and the amount of variability, \\(\\sigma^2\\). A plot of two normal distributions is given below: As we can see, these two curves are quite similar, and indeed, the underlying process that created each of them is the same. What is different, however, are the parameters governing how the data were generated. With this in mind, we have three goals for the present chapter Understand how a distribution represents a random process that creates data that is then observed Understand how the parameters of a distribution govern how the data is generated [and with what probability] Be able to identify which distributions underlying a given real world random process. Definitions Probability Distribution: A method for assigning probabilities to all possible events Distribution Parameters: Values associated with a probability distribution that determine how the data is generated 1.2 Flipping Coins In the previous chapter, we examined the possible events and associated probabilities with flipping a fair coin three times. In particular, we noted the collection of possible events was given by \\[\\mathcal{S} = \\{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT\\},\\] and the respective probabilities for the number of heads were # Heads Probability 0 1/8 1 3/8 2 3/8 3 1/8 In what ways might we formalize this as a process? We might start by identifying a few details about this experiment. First, we know that we are interested in coin flips, where each flip could be either one of two outcomes. We might also recognize that in this experiment we flipped a coin three times, with each flip having an equal probability of being Heads as it did Tails. In light of our previous discussion, which of these properties seem characteristic of a more general underlying process, and which of these could be changed while retaining the more general form? If we had flipped the coin 50 times, would the process be fundamentally different? Would this process be different if the probability of Heads was twice that of Tails? What we have identified above is a data generating mechanism, or distribution, known as the binomial distribution, in which each outcome is one of two states. In this example, the two states were Heads and Tails, but it could just as easily be described as success vs failure, adverse reaction vs non-adverse reaction, death vs non-death, etc.,. Most generally, we will consider the outcome to be either an “event” or a “non-event.” We next turn our attention the parameters of the distribution. As you may have guessed, there are two parameters associated with the binomial distribution, namely the number of observations (or flips), denoted \\(n\\), and the probability of a particular outcome being classified as an event, denoted \\(p\\). In our coin flipping example, flipping the coin three times gives us a parameter value of \\(n = 3\\). As we were interested in counting the number of Heads, we will call this our “event,” and note that it occurs with probability \\(p = 0.5\\). Together, these pieces define everything we need to know about a random process that follows a binomial distribution. Notionally, we write \\[ X \\sim Bin(n, p)\\] or, “the random variable \\(X\\) follows a binomial distribution with \\(n = 3\\) and probability of event \\(p = 0.5\\).” Our coin flipping example would then be expressed as \\(X \\sim Bin(n = 3, p = 0.5)\\), where \\(X\\) is our experiment. 1.3 Functional Representation of Probability Distributions We turn our attention now to the practical problem of determining how we might relate the idea of a probability distribution to determine the actual probabilities of given outcomes. From our definition above, we see that at a minimum, all we need is a method to assign a probability to a given event; within these bounds, we have a number of options available. Perhaps the most direct method of doing so consists of counting each of the possible outcomes by hand and determining their probabilities, which is precisely what was done when we identified \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and then counted the frequency in which different numbers of Heads occurred. This, of course, can become cumbersome quite quickly: with only \\(n = 3\\), we identified a total of 8 separate outcomes. If \\(n\\) were 4, this would increase to 16. One can quickly see the issue when considering an experiment in which the total number of coin flips was equal to \\(n = 50\\). This example was further made easier by the fact that each of the outcomes was equally likely; if the value of \\(p\\) was anything but \\(0.5\\), our task of assigning probabilities to these outcomes would have been significantly more challenging (see Chapter 4). Another possibility involves the use of simulation, the justification for which is covered in more detail in another chapter. By simulating this experiment a large number of times, we can determine the relative probabilities by counting the relative frequency of each outcome, which saves us the trouble of having to compute them mathematically. Here, we simulate this experiment \\(N = 10,000\\) times, and record the total number of heads in each experiment, dividing by the total number of experiments to get our desired probability Number of Heads Fraction Observed Probability True Probability 0 1,268/10,000 0.1268 0.125 1 3,772/10,000 0.3772 0.375 2 3,735/10,000 0.3735 0.375 3 1,225/10,000 0.1225 0.125 Of course as we can see, simulations have their own limitations: they often require a large number of replications, and because of randomness, the observed probabilities will rarely be exactly equal to the true probabilities. Nonetheless, simulations prove to be exceedingly useful when our experiment is complicated, or if a known distribution function for our problem does not exist. Our final method for specifying a probability distribution is with the use of a mathematical function, often referred to as a probability distribution function (pdf) or probability mass function (pmf), with the former reserved for continuous variables and the latter for those that are discrete. The binomial distribution, consisting of discrete outcomes, is specified with a pmf. For \\(X \\sim Bin(n, p)\\), we have the following formula: \\[ P(X = x) = \\binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} \\] where \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) are our distribution parameters, and \\(X\\) can take any of the values \\(x = 0, 1, \\dots, n\\). Perhaps new to us here is the leading term in the expression above, \\(\\binom{n}{x}\\), called the binomial coefficient, which can be written as \\[ \\binom{n}{x} = \\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} \\] where \\(n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times \\dots \\times 2 \\times 1\\) (known as a factorial). In words, we might say \\(\\binom{n}{x}\\) as “\\(n\\) choose \\(x\\).” While this may seem daunting at first, the need for it is quite reasonable. Consider again our coin flipping experiment, where the possible outcomes were listed as \\[ \\mathcal{S} = \\{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT\\}. \\] If we are interested in determining the probability of observing two Heads, it is of note that there are a number of instances above in which two Heads occurs. We might ask ourselves, “if we have \\(n = 3\\) flips, how many ways might we choose \\(x = 2\\) heads?” Writing this with our binomial coefficient, we find that \\[ \\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{2 \\times 1 \\cdot(1 \\times 1)} = \\frac62 = 3, \\] and indeed, 3 is precisely the number of outcomes in \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in which two Heads occur. Finally, using the pmf above, we can substitute in our distribution parameters \\(n = 3\\) and \\(p = 0.5\\) to find the distribution function that describes our experiment: \\[ P(X = x) = \\binom{3}{x} (0.5)^x (1-0.5)^{3-x} \\] [Exercise: verify that the probabilities returned by the binomial pmf match the true probabilities in the table above by plugging in values for \\(X = \\{0, 1,2,3\\}\\). ] 1.3.1 Plotting the PMF It is often useful to create a visual representation of a pmf as well. Doing so quickly gives us an idea of where data tend to aggregate and how the data are dispersed. Below are two plots representing two different sets of parameters for the binomials distribution. What do you notice in how they differ? How are they similar? What impacts do the different parameters have on the distribution of the data? Of particular note here, we recall from the previous chapter that the sum of all possible probabilities must be equal to one. Visually, this is represented by the total area of the bars in our plot. Given that our bars our rectangles, we can find the area by considering that the width of each bar is equal to 1, and it’s height is given by the probability of \\(X = x\\), which can be found using the PMF. On the left hand side, for example, from left to right, we have \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{Total Area } &amp;= \\text{ \\{Area of Heads = 0\\} + \\{Area of Heads = 1\\} + } \\\\ &amp; \\quad \\ \\ \\text{\\{Area of Heads = 2\\} + \\{Area of Heads = 3\\}} \\\\ &amp;= (1 \\times P(X = 0)) + (1 \\times P(X = 1)) + (1 \\times P(X = 2)) + (1 \\times P(X = 3)) \\\\ &amp;= 0.125+0.375+0.375+0.125 \\\\ &amp;= 1 \\end{align} \\] If, say, we are interested in the probability that \\(X = 2\\) or \\(X = 3\\), we can add the area of the two corresponding bars. In this case, we find \\(P(X = 2, 3) = 0.75\\). [Include binomial app here. See that clicking bars adds to something. Explain changing settings, clicking bars, selecting different things. Come up with exercises below, i.e., prob that even if n = 8, prob if even n = 4, etc.] 1.4 Measuring Heights Often, our data will not fit nicely into a finite number of discrete categories, leaving us with continuous data that are described with a probability distribution function, or pdf. As our data does not fit neatly into categorical bins, many of the techniques described above will not work in the same way here. Rest assured, the idea is exactly the same. While we will spare the technical details here, interested readers may consider what follows to be analogous to the cases presented above when the number of “bins” becomes infinite. Our motivating example here will consider the process of determining the height of individuals within a population. Unlike the binomial distribution, where the underlying process and associated parameters were easily teased apart, the components here are less obvious, and some care will be needed to identify them. Height data, like many things in the natural world, tend to follow a symmetric distribution, where most observations tend to gather around a mean value, with observations deviating from the mean being equally likely to fall some distance above the mean as below, their frequencies becoming smaller as this distance increases. That is to say, if the mean height of a population is 68 inches, an individual is equally likely to be 67 inches tall as they are 69 inches. Similarly, an individual is equally likely to be 64 inches as they are 82. However, given their proximity to the mean value, an individual is far more likely to be either 67 or 69 inches (1 inch from the mean) than they are to be either 64 or 82 inches (4 inches from the mean). The process described above describes what is known as a normal distribution, colloquially referred to as a “bell curve.” There are a number of properties that together characterize a normal distribution There are two parameters for the normal distribution, the mean \\(\\mu\\) (pronounced “myu”) and the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) (“sigma squared”) \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, or expected value, and represents the most probable value of the distribution. That is, observations from a normal distribution are more likely to be close to \\(\\mu\\) than away from it Observations are equally likely to be the same magnitude above \\(\\mu\\) as they are below it. In other words, the distribution is centered around \\(\\mu\\). We see this concept expressed in everyday language when we offer estimates of some value: “The cost is ‘x,’ plus or minus ‘y’” The second parameter, \\(\\sigma^2\\), describes how concentrated values are around the mean. The smaller the value of \\(\\sigma^2\\), the more observations that will be close to \\(\\mu\\). Likewise, larger values of \\(\\sigma^2\\) result in higher dispersion, or more values further away from \\(\\mu\\). Notationally, if a random variable \\(X\\) follows a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), we write \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). A special case of this that will be explored in following chapters is known as a standard normal distribution, which arises when the mean value is \\(\\mu = 0\\), and the variances is \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\). This distribution is often written with its own letter \\(Z\\), as in \\(Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\). Another critical difference between a continuous and discrete random variable is the way in which we determine probability. In the discrete case, we could enumerate all of the events and determine their relative frequency. Alternatively, we could run a simulation and simply count how often each outcome occurred. In the continuous case, however, there is no finite set of possibilities (i.e., somebody could be 68\" tall, 68.1\" tall, 68.01\", …), and any attempts to enumerate these will only terminate in frustration; we will determine the implications of this below. In the meantime, however, we will rejoice in knowing that a normal distribution can be mathematically represented by it’s probability function: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}} \\ e^{- \\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\] As we can see, the pdf contains both of the distribution parameters, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, different values for these parameters gives us different curves: Of particular interest above, notice how the value of \\(\\mu\\) changes where the data are aggregated, and similarly, note how larger values of \\(\\sigma^2\\) results in a greater amount of dispersion. Let’s now return to the issue of determining the probability of a particular event. In the discrete case, we saw that we could examine the plot of the pmf and multiply the width of each bin (which was equal to 1), with the height of the bin, given by the pmf While the pdf here does indeed give us the “height,” we quickly run into an issue when considering the width: the only way we can have an “infinite” number of bins for each outcome is to assign each bin a width of 0. As such, the probability of any particular event is unintuitively assigned a probability of zero. This apparent shortcoming can thankfully be remedied with the tools of calculus. Where discrete observations allow us to take a sum, the analogous case for continuous intervals is satisfied by the use of the integral. As it no longer makes sense to consider the probability of specific events (all of which will be zero), we instead consider the probability that an observation falls within a range of events. For example, if we have a random variable with \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), the probability that \\(X &gt; 3\\) can be written \\[ P(X &gt; 3) = \\int_3^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}} \\ e^{- \\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\ dx \\] Similarly, if we were curious to know the probability that \\(X\\) was between a range of values, say \\(2 &lt; X &lt; 5\\), we would write \\[ P(2 &lt; X &lt; 5) = \\int_2^{5} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma^2}} \\ e^{- \\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\ dx \\] Fortunately for us today, this no longer need be computed by hand. A number of computational resources are able to compute this for us with minimal effort. [Using app below, explore different parameter values. Use slider to select a range of probabilities.

The probabilities of outcomes are taken over a range, given as an integral. 1.5 Other Common Distributions Having examined in detail both discrete and properties distributions, demonstrated with the binomial and normal distributions, respectively, we consider below a brief overview of other common distributions and their properites. 1.5.1 Poisson Distribution The Poisson distribution, like the binomial, is a discrete distribution, in that it concerns itself with count data. Specifically, a Poisson distribution describes the number of independent events that may occur within a fixed interval of time. For example, we may be interested in the number of cars that pass through a busy intersection from noon to 1pm every day, or the number of major floods that occur in an area every 100 years. Perhaps the most famous example of the Poisson distribution comes courtesy of Ladislaus Bortkiewicz, a Russian statistician who, in 1898, showed that the number of Prussian soldiers killed by being kicked by a horse in a twenty year period followed a Poisson distribution (also child suicides, but that’s less fun). The Poisson distribution has a single parameter, \\(\\lambda\\), which describes the rate at which events occur, and a random variable following a Poisson distribution may be expressed as \\(X \\sim Pois(\\lambda)\\) (People who write \\(X \\sim Po(\\lambda)\\) are heathens). A random variable following a Poisson distribution has the following assumptions: The value of \\(X\\), being a count, can be any non-negative integer, i.e., \\(0, 1, 2, \\dots\\) with no upper bound The occurrence of one event in a time interval is independent of another event. One soldier being kicked by a horse has no impact on the probability of another solider being kicked by a horse. \\(\\lambda\\), which may be any number greater than \\(0\\), describes the rate at which events occur [Two events cannot occur at the exact same time, though they probably don’t need this] The distribution function of a Poisson random variable with rate \\(\\lambda\\) can be expressed \\[ P(X = x) = \\frac{\\lambda^x e^{-\\lambda}}{x!} \\] One surprisingly detail about the Poisson distribution is the relationship between the mean and the variance. For both, we have that \\(E(X) = Var(X) = \\lambda\\). 1.5.1.1 Plots for Poisson As we look at the plot for the Poisson, we will notice one aspect in particular that distinguishes it from the plots of both the binomial and normal distributions: it is no longer symmetric. This is a consequence of the range of values that a Poisson random variable can take on. Whereas a binomial random variable was bounded between \\(0\\) and \\(n\\), the number of trials conducted, and where the normal distribution allowed any real number, the Poisson is bounded below by \\(0\\), while having no theoretical upper bound. Given below is a plot of the distribution with \\(\\lambda = 2\\) and \\(\\lambda = 4\\) (it’s obvious here that choosing a specific value is inadequate. We can replace these plots with distribution exploration apps) Just as with the binomial distribution, we can determine the probability of an event or collection of events by determining the area of the bars in our plot.

To understand this further, the officials want to determine the average monthly spending on fast food for all Iowans. However, it would be very expensive and costly to have all 3.2 million Iowans track and report their total monthly spending on fast food. And certainly many Iowans would not be willing to share personal financial details with public health researchers or government officials. This means it is impossible for the officials to know the true mean amount of money that Iowans spend on fast food each month. The true numeric quantity about the population, such as this, is known as a population parameter. While we will never ever know the truth, there are still options. The officials can take a sample of Iowans and have those that consent to share their information report their monthly spending on fast food. Then, they can take the sample mean, which gives them an estimate of the average monthly spending on fast food. The sample mean is an example of a sample statistic, which is a numerical quantity about the sample. In other words, statistics are what investigators know, and parameters are what investigators want to know. The statistical framework (pictured below) allows us to make inference about population parameters using sample statistics. This means the researchers can use a random sample of Iowans’ monthly fast food spending to make generalizations about the average monthly spending for all Iowans. The numerical quantities of interest can be many different things - means, proportions, standard deviations, etc.. In the fast food example, the parameter of interest was a population mean and the sample statistic was the sample mean. In this chapter, we will specifically focusing on estimating means. Figure 2.1: Statistical Framework The statistical framework outlines the process of making inference using sample statistics to estimate population parameters. Later chapters in this textbook will cover the mathematical details of this process. In trying to make proper inference, we also want to ensure our estimated statistic is measuring the parameter well. To that end, there are two major statistical issues we concern ourselves with: On average, does our estimate tend to be centered around the true answer, or is it biased? How much variability is there likely to be in our sample? The difference between our estimate and our parameter is called bias. Variance describes the spread of our data, and is sometimes called noise. Sometimes we talk about spread in terms of precision, which is the inverse of variance. The more precision we have, the less variance, and vice versa. A good statistic will have little or no bias and would have minimal variability. We can visualize both bias and variability using a dart board analogy. Figure 2.2: Bias and Variability Illustration On the upper left target, the darts are hitting the bullseye with low bias and low variability, shown by the darts having minimal spread and all hitting the bullseye. This is the most desirable outcome when the goal is to hit the bullseye. In the upper right target, we see a lot more variability, as the darts are no longer highly concentrated on the bullseye. However, the dart locations are still centered around the bullseye, and this is why we consider this target to have low bias. This situation is less ideal than having low bias and low variance, but is still preferable to targets in the bottom row, where we have high bias. In the bottom left target, we have high bias and low variability, evidence by the high concentration of darts that are not hitting the bullseye. The consistency is why we saw there is low variability, but if our goal is to hit the bullseye, we are not going to achieve that goal. Finally, the bottom right target is the worst possible outcome - high bias and high variability. We are not hitting the bullseye and the darts are landing erratically. Statisticians work hard to develop inferential procedures that allow us to estimate population parameters with little to no bias and low variability. Definitions Population Parameter: The true numeric quantity about a population Sample Statistic: A numerical quantity about the sample Inference: The process of making generalizations about the population Bias: The difference between our estimate and our parameter Variability: The spread or error in the data Precision: Inverse of variance, how 2.2 Sampling Distributions In order to make inference, we must be able to quantify our uncertainty about the population parameter based on our sample data. To quantify our uncertainty, we must first establish where it comes from - the sampling process. Any time we take a sample from the population, we will get a different sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\). In other words, \\(\\overline{x}\\) is a numeric quantity which assumes a value based on the outcome of a random experiment - the process of drawing a sample at random from the population. This should sound familiar - this is the definition of a random variable! We can use this logic for any statistic of interest. As we’ve described in the past, random variables have probability distributions. When the random variable is a statistic, this probability distribution is called the sampling distribution. Sampling distributions reflect which values of the statistic are likely and which values are improbable. As we will see later in this chapter, this uncertainty depends on how many individuals we sample and how variable the data we measure is. Exercises The applet below is designed to help you get familiar with the concept of random sampling. The plot on the left side gives the population distribution. Each subject in the population is represented by one box, and the population consist of 26 people. The x-axis represents the value of the outcome variable for each individual, and when multiple people have the same value, their boxes are stacked on top of each other. For example, we have one subject in the population with a value of 0, three subjects with values of 1, and so on. The plot on the right displays the values for the subjects in our sample, and these subjects are indicated by green coloring in both the population and sample distributions. We can take samples from our population of various sizes by changing the value of the slider at the top and clicking on the “Sample” button. Set the sample size to 2 and click the “Sample” button five times. Fill out the following table with the sample means observed in your five samples. Sample Number Sample mean 1 2 3 4 5 Did you get the same sample mean for any of your five samples? Was the sample mean ever equal to the population mean in any of your five samples? If not, how close were your sample means to the true population mean? Now set the sample size to 15 and click the “Sample” button five times. Fill out the following table with the sample means observed in your five samples. Sample Number Sample mean 1 2 3 4 5 Did any of your five simulations give you a sample mean equal to the population mean? how close were your sample means to the true population mean? Compare your results from problem 1 and problem 2. In either case were you able to obtain a sample mean equal to the population mean? Which one had sample means with more variability? What does this indicate about the relationship between the sample size and the distribution of sample means in the context of repeated sampling? As we’ve seen earlier in this book, we will use upper-case letters to denote random variables, and lower-case letters to denote possible values they can take on. When it comes to the sampling distribution of the mean, \\(\\overline{X}\\) is the random variable, which arises from repeated random sampling from the population and then taking a sample mean, and \\(\\overline{x}\\) is an observed sample mean we might see. In describing a sampling distribution, we are often interested in the mean and standard deviation - this gives information about typical values the statistic might take on as well as how spread out the distribution is. We refer to the mean of a statistic as the expected value and the standard deviation as the standard error. For the random variable describing the sample mean, these are denoted as \\(E(\\overline{X})\\) and \\(SE(\\overline{X}) = \\sqrt{Var(\\overline{X})}\\), respectively. Let’s return to the fast food scenario to motivate our development, but for now let’s assume there are only five individuals in the entire population. The monthly spending for those five individuals (rounded to the nearest dollar) is as follows: Person Monthly Spending A 8 B 22 C 22 D 36 E 50 The population mean can be found by taking the average monthly spending of these five individuals, as they are the only people in this population. This means the population mean is 27.6. Now suppose we are taking samples of three individuals from this population. There are \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\) = 10 ways we can sample three people from this population. Since this is a small population, we can enumerate all possible samples, the values we would obtain for the monthly spending in each sample, and then the sample mean monthly fast food spending for each sample: Sample Values \\(\\overline{x}\\) (A, B, C) (8, 22, 22) 17.33 (A, B, D), (A, C, D) (8, 22, 36), (8, 22, 36) 22.00 (A, B, E), (A, C, E), (B, C, D) (8, 22, 50), (8, 22, 50), (22, 22, 36) 22.00 (A, D, E), (B, C, E) (8, 36, 50), (22, 22, 50) 26.67 (B, D, E), (C, D, E) (22, 36, 50), (22, 36, 50) 36.00 One thing to note is that none of the sample means are actually equal to the population mean. This is often the case! Based on this table, we can construct the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) for a sample of size three. Why is our sample mean often not equal to the population mean? Probability P(\\(\\overline{x}\\) = 17.33) 0.1 P(\\(\\overline{x}\\) = 22) 0.2 P(\\(\\overline{x}\\) = 26.67) 0.3 P(\\(\\overline{x}\\) = 31.33) 0.2 P(\\(\\overline{x}\\) = 36) 0.2 With this probability distribution, we can get the expected value of the sampling distribution. Whenever we think about probability, we are thinking about long-run frequencies, so when we think about the expected value, we are thinking about the average sample mean if we were to take repeated samples of size three from this population. The probability distribution indicates that if we took samples of size three from this population over and over again (say 1,000 times), we would end up with 10% with a mean of 17.33, 20% with a mean of 22, 30% with a mean of 26.67; and so on. So the expected value (average) we would observed if we kept taking samples over and over would be: (0.1 \\(\\times\\) 17.33) + (0.2 \\(\\times\\) 22) + (0.3 \\(\\times\\) 26.67) + (0.2 \\(\\times\\) 31.33) + (0.2 \\(\\times\\) 36) = 27.6 But wait! That is the population mean. This illustrates an extremely powerful property of the sample mean - the expected value of the sample mean (\\(\\overline{X}\\)) is equal to the population parameter (\\(\\mu\\))! Because of this, we say that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. While we illustrated the property with a small example, this holds regardless of the population or sample size. Definitions Expected Value: The mean of a statistic in repeated sampling Standard Error: The standard deviation of a statistic (including the mean) in repeated sampling Unbiased Estimator: The statistic with an expected value equal to the true population parameter 2.3 Central Limit Theorem In the last section, we used a toy example to conceptualize repeated sampling and the property of the sample mean being an unbiased estimator. Now we will formalize these properties. For any population distribution which can be described by a random variable \\(X\\) with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), the sample distribution of the mean based on sample of size \\(n\\) (\\(\\overline{X}_n\\)) has the following properties: The expected value of the sampling distribution is \\(\\mu\\) \\[E(\\overline{X}_n) = \\mu\\] The variance of the sampling distribution is \\[Var(\\overline{X}_n) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\] Using these formulas we are able to describe the typical value of the sample mean and how variable the sample mean is in repeated sampling. Notice that the expected value does not depend on the sample size, \\(n\\), but the variance does. This means regardless of the sample size, the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. But, as the sample size increases, the variance decreases, and we get a more precise estimate of the population mean. As we’ve seen in the past, it is more common to talk about the standard deviation than the variance and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The quantity \\(\\sqrt{Var(\\overline{X}_n)} = \\sigma / n\\) is primarily called the standard error of the mean, and is denoted by \\(SE(\\overline{X}_n)\\). We use the term standard error to make it really clear that it is referencing the sampling distribution of the mean, but all standard errors could be referred to as standard deviations. Conversely, not all standard deviations could be referred to as a standard error - the term is only used in describing the distribution of the sample mean. In addition to knowing the mean and standard error of the sample mean, we can also describe the distribution of sample means in repeated sampling. As we discussed in the last chapter on probability distributions, a distribution for the sample mean provides us with a way to quantify which sample mean values are likely and which values are unlikely. As it turns out, when we repeatedly sample from a population, and continue to calculate the sample mean from each sample, the distribution of the sample means will be normally distributed. This brings us what is largely considered the “fundamental theorem of statistics” Central Limit Theorem If the sample size is “large,” the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) is approximately normal, regardless of the characteristics of the underlying population. \\[\\overline{X}_n \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)\\] Generally, we consider a sample to be “large” enough if the sample size, \\(n \\geq 30\\). Because the variance of \\(\\overline{X}\\) is inversely related to the sample size, as the \\(n\\) increases, the variance decreases and the distribution becomes more concentrated. This is one of the most important, remarkable, and powerful results in all of statistics. In the real world, we rarely know the underlying population distribution of our data, however, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) says: we don’t have to! Exercises The applet below is designed to help your conceptual understanding of the CLT. You can change the underlying population distribution, the size of the samples taken (\\(n\\)), and the number of experiments performed. Each experiment consists of taking a sample of the specified size from the population and calculating the sample mean. The top left panel (blue) shows the underlying population distribution. The top right panel (red) shows the data from the most recent sample, with the sample mean from that specific sample indicated by the dashed black line. The bottom panel (gold) shows us the distribution of sample means from all the experiments, with the observed mean of the sample means indicated by the dashed black line and the true underlying population mean indicated by the solid blue line. Once you select the parameters to the values you want, click “Run Simulation” to tabulate the results. Set the population distribution to Normal, the sample size to 30, and perform 100 experiments to collect 100 sample means. Describe the histogram of the the data from the last experiment. Comment on the modality and skew. Describe the histogram of the distribution of sample means from all experiments. What is the range of values observed for the distribution of sample means? How does this compare the the range of values observed in the data from the last experiment? Now adjust the sample size to 100. Perform 100 experiments. What is the range of values observed for the distribution of sample means? How does this compare to the range observed when the sample size was 30? What about the range of values observed in the data from the last experiment - did this change much when the sample size was increased? Play around with various sample sizes. How does changing the sample size effect the spread of the distribution of sample means? Return to a sample size of 30, but change the population distribution to be right skewed. Perform 1,000 experiments. Describe the histogram of the the data from the last experiment. Comment on the modality and skew. Describe the histogram of the distribution of sample means from all experiments. Does it resemble the population distribution? Re-run the simulation using a sample size of 10. How does this effect the distribution of the sample means? How does this compare to what you observed when taking samples of size 10 with a normal population distribution? Change the population distribution to be left skewed, set the sample size to 80, and perform 1,000 experiments. Describe the histogram of the the data from the last experiment. Comment on the modality and skew. Describe the histogram of the distribution of sample means from all experiments. Does it resemble the population distribution? Run the simulation with these parameters a few times and pay attention to how the mean of the distribution of sample means compares to the population mean. Is the population mean similar or different from the mean of the sample means? What property does this illustrate? Change the parameters of the simulations as needed to answer the following true/false questions. Explain your answers. CLT tells us that the distribution of data from any experiment will be normally distributed. With a larger sample size, the data from the last experiment will resemble the population distribution. Performing 10 experiments is enough to see the effect of CLT. Regardless of the underlying population distribution and the sample size, the distribution of the sample means will be normally distributed. Increasing the sample size causes the data from a single experiment to look more and more normally distributed. "]
