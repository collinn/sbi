However, if we add a new file/chapter, we have to, from the console, input library(magrittr) bookdown::render_book(&#39;index.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;) (or whichever format we want. When closer to finshed, we can make a script to compile finished versions in multiple formats) Things you’ll need: install.packages(c(&quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;bookdown&quot;, &quot;servr&quot;, &quot;shiny&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;)) https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html 0.1 Stuff lifted that used to be in ch2 (may or may not be useful still?) We can also have R code normPop &lt;- rnorm(1e5, mean = 10, sd = 20) x &lt;- sample(normPop, size = 5, replace = TRUE) y &lt;- sample(normPop, size = 100, replace = TRUE) hist(normPop) abline(v = 10, col = &quot;blue&quot;, lwd = 2) abline(v = mean(x), col = &#39;red&#39;, lty = 2, lwd = 2) abline(v = mean(y), col = &#39;green&#39;, lty = 2, lwd = 2) But that’s boring and dumb when we can also have Shiny, though a few things of note, I guess While rmarkdown can host a self contained shiny app, bookdown requires a url. This is not ideal, and I will investigate if there is something that can be done about this Ok, whatever, I’m sure the library will host it for us. That would require internet access, though. We can still include the actual directories in our repo, or I think we can embed shiny if it is created as a single document instead of chapters This is dumb, but the shiny.rstudio website stopped hosting all of their shiny examples (?), and everything else is too complicated Oh, I know, we can just use the shiny server for public health! “To protect your security, ph-shiny.iowa.uiowa.edu will not allow Firefox to display the page if another site has embedded it. To see this page, you need to open it in a new window.” Here is a way complicated one that takes too long to load. Things I don’t like: Small window (maybe can adjust?) Scrolly window Yihui recommends miniUI for embedded shiny apps, but still Not yet sure what other options might exist # knitr::include_app(&#39;https://ph-shiny.iowa.uiowa.edu/collin/bookExample/&#39;, height = &#39;600px&#39;) # knitr::include_app(&#39;https://nardus.shinyapps.io/soilprofile/&#39;, height = &#39;600px&#39;) #knitr::include_app(&#39;https://yihui.shinyapps.io/miniUI/&#39;, height = &#39;600px&#39;) We can do this, but it’s not interactive # library(shiny) # shinyApp( # # ui = fluidPage( # selectInput(&quot;region&quot;, &quot;Region:&quot;, # choices = colnames(WorldPhones)), # plotOutput(&quot;phonePlot&quot;) # ), # # server = function(input, output) { # output$phonePlot = renderPlot({ # barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000, # ylab = &quot;Number of Telephones&quot;, xlab = &quot;Year&quot;) # }) # }, # # options = list(height = 500) # ) 0.2 Shiny test This authenticates your computer to load shiny apps rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name=&#39;ui-sbi&#39;, token=&#39;1C11998F5C3BED19B58AFD22D349483C&#39;, secret=&#39;DsgOVlwde3RKJzzu5Nd07xVFrr7gv56kZ8NAFKyP&#39;) library(rsconnect) ## Directory containing app, this uploads it to site #rsconnect::deployApp(&quot;../shinyApps/confidenceIntervals&quot;) 0.3 Mini UI No longer necessary :sunglasses: ## And then here it embeds with include_app #knitr::include_app(&#39;https://ph-shiny.iowa.uiowa.edu/collin/textbook2/&#39;, height = &#39;1000px&#39;) 0.4 Regular UI 0.5 Editing text Here are some things that were written that seem fine - this is maybe something we&#39;re not sure about + this is an idea or proposal we can discuss? But the actual code above looks like this ```diff Here are some things that were written that seem fine - this is maybe something we&#39;re not sure about + this is an idea or proposal we can discuss? ``` i think "]
