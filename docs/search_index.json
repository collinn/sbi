Random processes are defined in terms of the collection of possible events (sample space) and their associated probabilities. In that chapter, we saw three methods for calculating probabilities - the enumeration method, the probability function method, and the simulation method. In this chapter we will expand on the probability function method, which uses a known function called a probability distribution to determine the probability of each event. Probability distributions are closely related to random variables, a numeric variable that can take on different values depending on the outcome of a random process. In previous mathematics courses you may have seen variables such as \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) used as placeholder values which are then solved for. For example, you can solve for the variable \\(x\\) in \\(4x + 5 = 25\\), to determine \\(x = 5\\). By contrast, the outcome of a random variable cannot be predetermined. Instead, we talk probabilistically about the likelihood of observing each possible outcome. Random variables are typically denoted with capital letters, e.g., \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\), whereas the observed outcome of the random process is denoted with lowercase letters \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). For example, flipping a coin three times is a random process. We can define the random variable \\(X\\) to represent the number of heads we observe between the three flips. \\(X\\) can take on four possible values: 0, 1, 2, or 3. If we observe 2 heads, we have \\(x = 2\\). Most simply, a probability distribution (often just called a distribution) is a method for taking a possible event as input, and giving us the corresponding probability as output; the corresponding probability tells us how likely it is that the specific event will occur, out of all of the possible events. We often say random variables have or follow a probability distribution, as the distribution quantifies the probability of observing the possible values a random variable can take on. We can denote a probability distribution as \\(P(X = x)\\), or the probability that the random variable, \\(X\\), takes on a generic value, \\(x\\). There are many useful probability distributions that have been defined by mathematicians and statisticians to describe a variety of scenarios: Counting the number of successes in a fixed number of trials that can results in either success or failure Counting the number of failures before the first success in a series of success/failure trials Describing the length of time between events that occur at a constant rate Describing the blood pressure of adults One can represent a probability distribution visually using a probability histogram. On the x-axis, we have the possible outcomes of the random process - the values the random variable could take on. For each outcome, the bar height represents the probability of observing that value. For the coin flipping example, the probabilities of observing each possible number of heads can be represented as: When looking at a probability histogram, we can characterize the shape of the distribution analogously to how we talk about a histogram of observed data. We often use unimodal distributions, which may or may not be skewed. For example, the above probability histogram shows a unimodal and symmetric distribution. The beauty of using probability distributions to describe the likelihood of all outcomes of a random process is its simplicity. Probability distributions rely on a small number of parameters which determine the distributions shape. In the coin flipping example, we could consider one of the parameters to be the probability of obtaining heads. We assume that we have a fair coin and that this probability is 50%. If, instead, we had a weighted coin with a 60% chance of landing on heads, the probability distribution would change. With a higher chance of the coin resulting in heads, we now see that the three flips are more likely to result in 2 or 3 heads, and much less likely to result in 0 heads. In other words, the distribution is now slightly skewed left. Because these probabilities can be described by a distribution function, which depends on the probability of heads, we can easily compute and compare the probabilities of each outcome depending on the coins true chance at turning up as heads. Another key concept related to probability distributions and random variables, is the idea of the expected value. The expected value of a random variable, often denoted as \\(E(X)\\), is a weighted average which provides a measure of the central mass of the probability distribution. The expected value averages over all possible outcomes of the random variable with each outcome weighted according to its probability. Returning to the coin flipping example, with a fair coin we have seen that the probability distribution is: x P(X = x) 0 0.125 1 0.375 2 0.375 3 0.125 So the expected value is \\[(0 \\times 0.125) + (1 \\times 0.375) + (2 \\times 0.375) + (3 \\times 0.125) = 1.5.\\] Looking at the probability histogram, this value should make sense as it falls right in the center of the distribution. Expected values are more easily conceptualized in terms of a game or bet. For example, consider the following game. You flip a fair coin; if the coin lands on heads, you win $20 and if the coin lands on tails, you lose $1. Would you play this game? Assuming you have a spare dollar, the answer is probably yes. Since you have equal chances of the coin landing on heads or tails, you are just as likely to win $20 as you are to lose $1. In terms of the expected value, it would be \\[(20 \\times 0.5) + (-1 \\times 0.5) = 9.5\\] The expected value tells us that if you were to play this game over and over, you would be expected to win $9.5 per game. If instead the game was that for heads you won $1 and for tails you lost $1, would you still want to play? Definition 6.1   Probability distribution: A method for assigning probabilities to all possible events Random variable: A method for assigning probabilities to all possible events Probability histogram: Values associated with a probability distribution that determine the distributions shape Parameters: Values associated with a probability distribution that determine the distributions shape Expected value: The weighted average of the outcomes of a random variable, with weights determined by their probability. 6.2 Binomial Distribution One common probability distribution is the binomial distribution, which describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials that can result in one of two outcomes (success or failure), when each trial has the same probability of success. We have already seen one example of the binomial distribution - flipping a coin three times counting the number of flips that result in heads (success). Each flip has two possible outcomes (heads or tails), the same probability of heads (50%), and we have predetermined the number of trials (3 flips). Another example of the binomial distribution is rolling a six-sided die 10 times and counting the number of rolls that result in a 5 or 6. In this example, each die roll has a 1/3 chance of turning up a 5 or 6 and the die will be rolled 10 times. As you may have noticed in these binomial distribution examples, the distribution can be used for various probabilities of success and numbers of trials. In fact, these quantities define the two parameters of the binomial distribution. These parameters are denoted as \\(n\\) = the number of trials and \\(p\\) = the probability of success. The binomial distribution is written as a function of these parameters \\[ P(X = x) = \\binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}. \\] While this may look like a nasty formula, it can be easily computed by any statistical software so there is no need to calculate the probability by hand. For any valid value of \\(n\\) and \\(p\\), we can use the binomial distribution to compute the probability of observing any possible outcome. To illustrate this, we will consider a binomial distribution with \\(n = 10\\) trials. The following figure shows the probability histograms for four different values of \\(p\\). When \\(p\\) is 0.2, we are more likely to observe a lower number of successes, than to observe 8 or more successes. When \\(p\\) is 50%, we are most likely to observe 5 of the 10 trials resulting in a success, with the probability decreasing as the number of successes gets closer to 0 or 10. For a large success probability of 90%, there is a very small chance we observe less than 6 successes and a much higher probability of observing 9 or 10 successes. The expected value of the binomial distribution is given by \\(E(X) = np\\) Exercise 6.1   The applet below is designed to help you get familiar with the parameters of the binomial distribution, and how they impact the probability distribution. You can change the values of the number of trials \\(n\\), and the probability of success \\(p\\), and the app will display the associated distribution in a probability histogram. Use the applet to answer the following questions: Set \\(n = 10\\), and change the value of \\(p\\) (note: you can press the triangular play button to have the app vary \\(p\\) automatically). What happens to the shape of the distribution as \\(p\\) gets closer to 0? What about when \\(p\\) gets closer to 1? Now, set \\(p = 0.4\\) and vary \\(n\\) over the range of possible inputs. What do you notice about the x-axis as \\(n\\) is changing? Explain this trend by referring back to what \\(n\\) represents. Keeping \\(p\\) constant, as \\(n\\) changes between 20 - 50, does the shape of the distribution change? What about the location of the distribution? Exercise 6.2 Exercises The applet below is designed to familiarize you with data generated from the binomial distribution. You can change the values of the number of trials \\(n\\), and the probability of success \\(p\\) to specify the parameters of the population distribution. Then, Definition 6.2   Binomial Distribution: A probability distribution that characterizes the probabilities of observing some number of successes in a fixed number of trials, each with two possible outcomes and the same probability of success. Discrete Distribution: Any probability distribution that depicts the occurrence of countable values. 6.3 Normal Distribution Included below are histograms of the depth of Lake Huron from 1875-1972, the annual flow of the Nile river in cubic meters from 1871-1970, and the height in feet of 31 black cherry trees. What do these histograms seem to have in common? What we see here are examples of a normal distribution (also known as a bell curve), one of the most ubiquitous distributions in all of statistics. The normal distribution is characterized by the bell shape that is symmetric about its mean [but maybe dont say mean]. Like the binomial, the normal distribution is characterized by two parameters, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\), representing the mean and the variance, respectively. The mean value, \\(\\mu\\), indicates the location of the peak on the x-axis, whereas the variance, \\(\\sigma^2\\), indicates the amount of dispersion about the mean. A random variable \\(X\\) that follows a normal distribution can be expressed \\(X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), or, The random variable \\(X\\) follows a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The formula for the normal distribution is given as \\[ \\begin{align*} f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} \\ e^{- \\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}. \\end{align*} \\] Consider the two normal distributions below, with different values for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). Although they are centered at different locations and have different amounts of dispersion around the mean, they are both bell-shaped curves characteristic of the normal distribution: Given that the normal distribution appears so frequently in statistics, it is common practice to standardize a normal distribution so that it has a mean value of \\(\\mu = 0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2 = 1\\). A normal random variable that has been standardized is called a standard normal distribution and is often written \\(Z \\sim N(0,1)\\). We can consider again the histograms above, once theyve been standardized: Unlike the binomial distribution, in which there are \\(n\\) possible values that our random variable can take, the normal distribution represents a random variable that is continuous over a range of values. Instead of asking the probability of a specific value, say, \\(Z = 0\\), probabilities are given as the area under the curve for a certain interval. We might ask, What is the probability that \\(Z\\) is one standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) away from 0? pr perhaps, What is the probability that \\(Z &lt; 0\\)? Because probabilities for continuous distributions are described as areas under the curve, their values are computed with integrals. [do we introduce probability tables or just go with the app?] also maybe include subtract cdf? probability that |Z| &gt; z? what else? [Using app below, explore different parameter values. Use slider to select a range of probabilities. Note that the area of interest is highlighted. Do exercises with it] Definition 6.3   Normal Distribution: A continuous bell-shaped distribution with two parameters that are the mean value, \\(\\mu\\), with a variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Continuous Distribution: A special case of the normal distribution, \\(Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\) Standard Normal Distribution: A special case of the normal distribution, \\(Z \\sim N(0, 1)\\) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
