Florence Nightingale 1.1 Statistics and Evidence-based Research Dr. Anne Ecdote bases all her decisions off things shes observed. Dr. Eva Dense bases her practice off well-researched studies. Dr. Opi Yon bases his practice off his personal beliefs. You visit each doctor with a headache. Dr. Ecdote says the last person she saw with a headache had a brain tumor, so you should probably get an MRI. Dr. Yon says headaches are a construct of our imagination and that if you would just stop thinking about it, it will go away. Dr. Dense recommends a pain reliever that has been studied in several large clinical trials and repeatedly shown to be effective at reducing headaches. Which doctor would you listen to? There are many definitions of statistics: the science of learning from experiences the study of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data the mathematics of uncertainty a required college course designed to make everyone miserable All of these definitions hold some truth (some more than others - well let you guess which ). Statistics is a highly interdisciplinary field, with methods applicable to and used by a wide variety of disciplines. The importance of the field of statistics lies in its ability to quantify our uncertainty about a potential outcome - such as the most likely cause and treatment for a headache. Almost everything in life is associated with some uncertainty - the weather, your career, the connection between your genetics and your response to certain medications. However, just because something isnt known with 100% certainty, doesnt mean we cant understand it better. Statistics helps us understand the world better by allowing us to measure our uncertainty, describe associations between phenomena, and make informed decisions. And how exactly do statisticians To make evidence-based conclusions, we need to collect, process, analyze, and interpret data in order to draw conclusions in an objective manner. 1.2 Scientific Method In principle, people collect and process information every day of their lives. Since its something we do frequently, you might think we would be really good at itbut were not. Unfortunately, humans are not natural statisticians. We are not good at picking out patterns from a sea of noisy data. And, on the flip side, we are too good at picking out non-existent patterns from small numbers of observations. We also find it difficult to sort out the effects of multiple factors occurring simultaneously and we are subject to all sorts of biases depending on our personalities, emotions, and past experiences. Some examples of these would be good. The scientific method is the process used to answer scientific questions. Ask a question Do background research Construct a hypothesis Test your hypothesis with a study or an experiment Analyze data and draw conclusions How do the results align with your hypothesis? Communicate results learn more statistics here 1.3 Introduction to Biostatistics Biostatitsics pertains to statistics as applied to medical, biological, and health sciences. In these fields, we must often make decisions in the presence of uncertainty: Which drug should a doctor prescribe to treat an illness? Can we predict the logevity of the national population to inform government decisions regarding Social Security? What factors increase the risk of an individual developing coronary heart disease? These questions are too important to be left to opinion, superstition, and conjecture. Thus, there has been a tremendous push for objective, evidence-based decision making in medicine, public health, and policy making. Statistics is the science that allows us to make these decisions. Much of statistics was developed in the context of agricultural students, where every aspect of a plants life can be controlled. We can create different plots of land, each with a different fertilizer, soil, sun-exposure, water, etc. and plan the same seed in each plot. Studies of humans are quite different. We cant control every aspect of a persons life, such as what they eat or where they work (no matter how great it would be for scientific purposes). There are ethical considerations - if we wanted to research the effects of smoking on lung cancer, we would not be able to force people to smoke (or not). Humans are also incredibly diverse and variable, not to mention expensive to perform research upon. Despite these issues, there is a moral imperative to make decisions on potentially life-saving therapies as fast as possible. For these reasons, biostatistics has emerged as an important field within statistics. 1.4 Statistical framework There are three basic questions in statistics: How should I collect my data? How should I describe and summarize the data Ive collected? What does my data tell me about the way the world works? Throughout the book, we will cover different ways of analyzing data and making conclusions about the way the world works. Depending on the type of data, there are different methods of analysis. In general, scientists use the scientific method to make generalizations about classes of people on the basis of their studies. The class of people that they are trying to make generalizations about is called the population. Most of the time, it is impratical and expensive to study all individuals in a population - although the United States government does do the best they can every 10 years. Instead of sampling everyone in the population, or taking a census, typically we study only a portion of th the population called the sample. In order to determine how best to obtain a sample to answer the research questions, we must be cautious about the study design. Then, researchers make generalizations, or inference, about the entire population based on studying the sample. We can visualize the statistical framework using this diagram: Figure 1.1: Statistical Framework 1.5 What is a simulation? Many times in this book, we will illustrate or investigate a concept with a simulation. A simulation is a computer generated experiment where the user gets to specify the true mechanism for generating data. For example, we could flip a fair coin over and over again and record whether each flip results in heads or tails. OR, we could tell a computer to simulate a pre-specified number of flips with the probability of heads being 50% and get our results in a fraction of a second. flipCoin &lt;- function(nFlips) { dat &lt;- rbinom(nFlips, 1, 0.5) dat &lt;- ifelse(dat == 1, &#39;Heads&#39;, &#39;Tails&#39;) dat } flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; Simulations are great tools for understanding the concept of randomness. For example, every time we simulate coin flips using the tool above, we will get a different data set: flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; This is exactly what happens when scientists conduct a research study. If they were carry out a study in exactly the same way - sampling individuals from the same population and measuring the same quantities, they would get different results every time. This is because while each sample is from the same population, each sample will contain different individuals. Each sample is random! "]]
