However, if we add a new file/chapter, we have to, from the console, input library(magrittr) bookdown::render_book(&#39;index.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;) (or whichever format we want. When closer to finshed, we can make a script to compile finished versions in multiple formats) Things you‚Äôll need: install.packages(c(&quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;bookdown&quot;, &quot;servr&quot;, &quot;shiny&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;)) https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html 0.1 Stuff lifted that used to be in ch2 (may or may not be useful still?)

Dr.¬†Eva Dense bases her practice off well researched studies. Dr.¬†Opi Yon bases his practice off his personal beliefs. You visit each doctor with a headache. Dr.¬†Ecdote says the last person she saw with a headache had a brain tumor, so you should probably get an MRI. Dr.¬†Yon says headaches are a construct of our imagination and that if you would just stop thinking about it, it would go away. Dr.¬†Dense recommends a pain reliever that has been studied in several large clinical trials and repeatdtly shown to be effective at reducing headaches. There are many definitions of statistics: 1) the science of learning from experiences 2) the science of uncertainty To make evidence-based conclusions, we need to collect, process, analyze, and interpret data in order to draw conclusions in an objective manner. 1.2 Scientific Method In principle, people collect and process information every day of their lives. Since it‚Äôs something we do frequently, you might think we would be really good at it‚Ä¶but we‚Äôre not. Unfortunately, humans are not natural statisticians. We are not good at picking out patterns from a sea of noisy data. And, on the flip side, we are too good at picking out non-existent patterns from small numbers of observations. We also find it difficult to sort out the effects of multiple factors occurring simultaneously and we are subject to all sorts of biases depending on our personalities, emotions, and past experiences. Some examples of these would be good. The scientific method is the process used to answer scientific questions. Ask a question Do background research Construct a hypothesis Test your hypothesis with a study or an experiment Analyze data and draw conclusions How do the results align with your hypothesis? Communicate results learn more statistics here 1.3 Introduction to Biostatistics Biostatitsics pertains to statistics as applied to medical, biological, and health sciences. In these fields, we must often make decisions in the presence of uncertainty: Which drug should a doctor prescribe to treat an illness? Can we predict the logevity of the national population to inform government decisions regarding Social Security? What factors increase the risk of an individual developing coronary heart disease? These questions are too important to be left to opinion, superstition, and conjecture. Thus, there has been a tremendous push for objective, evidence-based decision making in medicine, public health, and policy making. Statistics is the science that allows us to make these decisions. Much of statistics was developed in the context of agricultural students, where every aspect of a plant‚Äôs life can be controlled. We can create different plots of land, each with a different fertilizer, soil, sun-exposure, water, etc. and plan the same seed in each plot. Studies of humans are quite different. We can‚Äôt control every aspect of a person‚Äôs life, such as what they eat or where they work (no matter how great it would be for scientific purposes). There are ethical considerations - if we wanted to research the effects of smoking on lung cancer, we would not be able to force people to smoke (or not). Humans are also incredibly diverse and variable, not to mention expensive to perform research upon. Despite these issues, there is a moral imperative to make decisions on potentially life-saving therapies as fast as possible. For these reasons, biostatistics has emerged as an important field within statistics. 1.4 Statistical framework There are three basic questions in statistics: How should I collect my data? How should I describe and summarize the data I‚Äôve collected? What does my data tell me about the way the world works? Throughout the book, we will cover different ways of analyzing data and making conclusions about the way the world works. Depending on the type of data, there are different methods of analysis. In general, scientists use the scientific method to make generalizations about classes of people on the basis of their studies. The class of people that they are trying to make generalizations about is called the population. Most of the time, it is impratical and expensive to study all individuals in a population - although the United States government does do the best they can every 10 years. Instead of sampling everyone in the population, or taking a census, typically we study only a portion of th the population called the sample. In order to determine how best to obtain a sample to answer the research questions, we must be cautious about the study design. Then, researchers make generalizations, or inference, about the entire population based on studying the sample. We can visualize the statistical framework using this diagram: Figure 1.2: Statistical Framework 1.5 What is a simulation? Many times in this book, we will illustrate or investigate a concept with a simulation. A simulation is a computer generated experiment where the user gets to specify the true mechanism for generating data. For example, we could flip a fair coin over and over again and record whether each flip results in heads or tails. OR, we could tell a computer to simulate a pre-specified number of flips with the probability of heads being 50% and get our results in a fraction of a second. flipCoin &lt;- function(nFlips) { dat &lt;- rbinom(nFlips, 1, 0.5) dat &lt;- ifelse(dat == 1, &#39;Heads&#39;, &#39;Tails&#39;) dat } flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; Simulations are great tools for understanding the concept of randomness. For example, every time we simulate coin flips using the tool above, we will get a different data set: flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; flipCoin(5) ## [1] &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Tails&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; &quot;Heads&quot; This is exactly what happens when scientists conduct a research study. If they were carry out a study in exactly the same way - sampling individuals from the same population and measuring the same quantities, they would get different results every time. This is because while each sample is from the same population, each sample will contain different individuals. Each sample is random! "],
["ch2.html", "2 What is Data? 2.1 Outline 2.2 Types of Data 2.3 Categorical Data 2.4 Continuous data", " 2 What is Data? ‚ÄúNumerical quantities focus on expected values, graphical summaries on unexpected values.‚Äù ‚Äî John Tukey There are two main branches of statistics: descriptive statistics, which deals with methods for summarizing and/or presenting data and inferential statistics, which deals with methods for making generalizations about a population based on information in the sample. In this chapter, we will be focused on descriptive statistics using both numerical and graphical summaries. 2.1 Outline Introduction Summaries (this maybe unnecessary?) What is a plot/figure? What is a table? Types of Data Categorical Continuous Categorical visual summary numerical summary Continuous Visual summary Numerical Summary Summary of Info Headers in this document need a LOT of work Data can be virtually anything that can be observed and recorded, including how tall you are, the number of cars of any color in town, or how many words are in each of the books in the library of congress. Just as the different types of data can vary considerably, so can the amount of data, ranging from a single number (your height) to gigabytes of data (number of words in all books definitely can‚Äôt be much larger than a few Mb, so maybe a better example). As the size of the data increases, so does the difficulty of making sense of it in raw form. We can condense large quantities of data into human readable forms through the use of data summaries, often displayed in the forms of tables and figures. However, in doing so, information can often be lost in the process. A good data summary will seek to strike a balance between clarity and completeness of information. 2.1.1 Summaries 2.2 Types of Data Before getting too far into the weeds, let‚Äôs consider the two broad types of data that we may see in the wild, which we will call Categorical data and Continuous data. First up is Categorical data (also known as Qualitative or Discrete data) which, as the name suggets, is data that falls into discrete categories. Categorical data can further be classified into two distinct types: Nominal data: data that exists without any sort of natural or apparent ordering, e.g., colors (red, green, blue), gender (male, female), and type of motor vehicle (car, truck, SUV). Ordinal data: data that does have a natural ordering, e.g., education (high school, some college, college) and injury severity (low, medium, high) Continuous data, on the other hand, is data that can be any numeric value on some interval or on a continuum. This generally includes things that can be measured quantitatively, such as height, weight, and temperature. (Any sort of tie-in between bar charts and histograms? I.e., the discretizing of an interval? I would think not) Different types of data can be summarized in a number of ways, which we‚Äôll explore in the next section. 2.3 Categorical Data Titanic dataset might also be good here? &lt;- probably too complicated. In fact, we should probably reduce the dataset below to make it simpler I am also wondering if I should not rearrange the order in which this is presented? That is, maybe we should start with plots rather than tables. For categorical data, leading with either seems fine, but for continuous data, plots seem far more intuitive to begin with, and numerical summaries coming next Let‚Äôs begin by considering a dataset of survey responses for 592 students responding with their hair color, eye color, and sex. This dataset includes responses from male and female students, with hair colors that are black, brown, red, and blond, and eyes that are brown, blue, hazel, and green. Note that these are qualitative measures, suggesting that are dealing with categorical data. Trying to make sense of 592 observations is a daunting task, so we can being by taking the data we have and summarizing it in a useful way. For categorical data, this is often as simple as counting the number of times an observation falls into a category. For example, how many observations were male with brown hair and green eyes? Or females with red hair and blue eyes? Let‚Äôs take a look at this dataset with pairs counted together in the Freq column: library(knitr) data(HairEyeColor) haireyecolor &lt;- as.data.frame(HairEyeColor) haireyecolor ## Gross way of doing this dt &lt;- data.frame(Hair = NA, Eye = NA, Sex = NA, Freq = NA) j &lt;- 1 for(i in seq_len(nrow(haireyecolor))) { freq &lt;- haireyecolor[i, &quot;Freq&quot;] for(k in seq_len(freq)) { dt[j, ] &lt;- haireyecolor[i, ] j &lt;- j + 1 } } dt$Freq &lt;- NULL nrow(dt) ## [1] 592 By simply adding like values together, we have reduced 592 observations into 32 data points, indicating that pairing of sex, hair and eye color, as well as the number of subjects with each. Note here that in this summary of the data, no data/information was lost. That is, with these 32 rows, we could just as easily expand this out to having one row for each observation, with the number indicated in the Freq column. Something about how summarizing data doesn‚Äôt always preserve everything. Suppose first we are only interested in a portion of this data, that is, we are only interested in asking questions about hair color. The first thing we might do, then, is count how many of each hair color was observed in our dataset # hair &lt;- dt$Hair # eye &lt;- dt$Eye # sex &lt;- dt$Sex # why does rmarkdown insist on pissing me off always? tab &lt;- table(dt$Hair) nn &lt;- names(tab) tab &lt;- as.numeric(tab) names(tab) &lt;- nn tab ## 1 2 3 4 ## 108 286 71 127 This kind of counting is known as absolute frequency, which gives us a single value indicating the total number of observations. In looking at the table above, it is clear that there are far more observations with brown hair than black, blond, and red. We gather this information by looking at the total number of observations with brown hair, and noticing that this number is quite a bit larger than any of the other observations. However, suppose somebody asks you how common brown hair is relative to others. Does it make sense to response ‚ÄúOh, there are 286 individuals with brown hair‚Äù? Without knowing the values for the other hair colors, this number alone doesn‚Äôt carry much meaning. Is 286 observations a lot? It depends. Were 300 people examined? 3,000? Without knowing anything about the rest of the data, the absolute frequency may not be very useful. In addition to actual counts of observations in categorical data, we may often be interested in rates. A rate can be as simple as taking the total number of a single category observed, and stating it in terms of the total number of observations. For example, instead of simplying saying ‚Äú286 subjects who were observed had brown hair,‚Äù we might instead say ‚Äú286 of 592 subjects examined had brown hair.‚Äù Perhaps more familiar to use is a percentage, also known as a proportion, which is a special type of rate, specified as the number of instances per 100 observations. We determine this by evaluating the rate with division. That is, 286 of 592 subjects becomes \\(286/592 = 0.4831 = 48.31\\%\\). We can now show the same table above, in terms of percentages prop.table(tab) ## 1 2 3 4 ## 0.18243 0.48311 0.11993 0.21453 By considering all observations as rates per one hundred, we can quickly compare the relative counts of our observations. For example, we can quickly note that about half of the observations collected had brown hair, and almost twice as many had blond hair compared to red. This kind of counting, as opposted to the raw numbers, is known as relative frequency. This has given us a few ways to provide numerical summaries of the data through the use of tables, but we can just as easily obtain visual summaries as well with the use of figures and plots. For categorical data, visual summaries often come in the form of bar plots. Below is a demonstration of a bar plot for the absolute frequencies of hair color found above barplot(tab, main = &quot;Why does bookdown change hair color to numbers everywhere?&quot;) &lt; This is possibly too much info for the 2x2 tables. We can perhaps choose one margin to run with? &gt; Numerical and visual summaries become even more useful as our data becomes more complicated. Let‚Äôs continue with the example we had before, but now let us also break down observations with each hair color by eye color as well. This process is known as stratification table2 &lt;- with(dt, table(Eye, Hair)) table2 ## Hair ## Eye 1 2 3 4 ## 1 68 119 26 7 ## 2 20 84 17 94 ## 3 15 54 14 10 ## 4 5 29 14 16 First, we notice that by taking sums down the columns, we arrive at the same numbers that we had when only hair color was considered. If we were to sum these numbers up, they would add to 592, the total number of observations in our dataset. In other words, we haven‚Äôt lost any information related to the number of observations with each hair color, but we have added information to our summary by including eye color as well. One will also notice that if we sum horizontally, we get the total number of observations with each eye color as well. This is done in the margins in the table below. Note that the sum of both margin totals add up to 592, the total number of observations, as indicated by the bottom right corner. addmargins(table2) ## Hair ## Eye 1 2 3 4 Sum ## 1 68 119 26 7 220 ## 2 20 84 17 94 215 ## 3 15 54 14 10 93 ## 4 5 29 14 16 64 ## Sum 108 286 71 127 592 Similar to our previous example, these numbers represent the absolute frequencies of our observations. Unlike the previous example, however, we now have several ways in which we might compute the relative frequencies. In particular, this asks the question ‚Äúrelative to what?‚Äù For the table above, there are three ‚Äúwhats‚Äù that may be of interest How many in each category, relative to the entire population How many in each eye color, within hair color How many in each hair color, within eye color I‚Äôm not sure which, if any, are relevant, so I won‚Äôt write these out just yet. Also, I know, magrittr. It‚Äôs just here for convienience # by population prop.table(table2) ## Hair ## Eye 1 2 3 4 ## 1 0.1148649 0.2010135 0.0439189 0.0118243 ## 2 0.0337838 0.1418919 0.0287162 0.1587838 ## 3 0.0253378 0.0912162 0.0236486 0.0168919 ## 4 0.0084459 0.0489865 0.0236486 0.0270270 # by hair color prop.table(table2, margin = 2) %&gt;% addmargins(1) ## Hair ## Eye 1 2 3 4 ## 1 0.629630 0.416084 0.366197 0.055118 ## 2 0.185185 0.293706 0.239437 0.740157 ## 3 0.138889 0.188811 0.197183 0.078740 ## 4 0.046296 0.101399 0.197183 0.125984 ## Sum 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000 # by eye color prop.table(table2, margin = 1) %&gt;% addmargins(2) ## Hair ## Eye 1 2 3 4 Sum ## 1 0.309091 0.540909 0.118182 0.031818 1.000000 ## 2 0.093023 0.390698 0.079070 0.437209 1.000000 ## 3 0.161290 0.580645 0.150538 0.107527 1.000000 ## 4 0.078125 0.453125 0.218750 0.250000 1.000000 barplot(table2, beside = TRUE, main = &quot;By Hair Color&quot;) barplot(t(table2), beside = TRUE, main = &quot;By Eye Color&quot;) Seemingly, we‚Äôll just need to go back and do everything in ggplot, because this is just ridiculous. I feel silly mentioning mode. Probably the best way to fill in the stuff above is come up with questions and then answer them by looking at table. It might be easier if we find something with less categories. Maybe I could do sex instead of eye color? I wish I would have thought of that before doing everything above 2.4 Continuous data faithful data cool because it‚Äôs bimodal, but that also makes transition into measures of center, spread, and skewness more difficult. Possibly not bad is airquality It has Ozone (skew) Solar radiation (skew but closer to uniform) Wind in mph (bimodal) Temp (normal) Note: also option to not use formal data set and just use distributions to control skew While tables of frequencies and barcharts are great for data that can be counted and categorized, it does not give us much in terms of dealing with continuous data, which could have potentially an infinite number of different values. Like categorical date, continuous data is typically summarized in two ways: Graphical Visualizations Numerical Summaries Let‚Äôs begin by looking at each of these in turn. 2.4.1 Graphical Summaries Let‚Äôs begin by considering a hypothetical dataset in which we have collected the age, in years, of 50 subjects. ## Idk, I wanted something maybe not uniform? This can be changed set.seed(123) age &lt;- c(sample(20:29, 25, replace = TRUE), sample(30:60, 25, replace = TRUE)) age ## [1] 22 22 29 21 25 24 23 25 28 29 24 22 28 28 28 22 27 29 26 29 28 22 23 20 26 50 41 44 39 42 36 38 38 39 52 56 ## [37] 57 50 36 50 56 35 54 31 58 34 37 41 60 42 Now, we could consider counting the number of subjects at each age and, similar to the plots in categorical data, create a plot demonstrating what our sample looks like table(age) ## age ## 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 31 34 35 36 37 38 39 41 42 44 50 52 54 56 57 58 60 ## 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 1 5 4 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 3 1 1 2 1 1 1 barplot(table(age)) While this is slightly more helpful than the raw numerical values, it‚Äôs not by much. We can see that some ages are more prevelant than others, but we still have 40 separate values that we are looking at on our graph. As an alternative, we can consider a histogram which, similar to a barplot, aggregates values into bins. Let‚Äôs look at the same data above, but now binning our observations into sets of ten years (25-34, 35-44, etc) hist(age, breaks = seq(min(age), max(age), by = 10)) Notice how this paints a slightly different picture than the barplot above. Whereas the first plot gave us counts for each individual age, the histogram gives us a graphical summary of the ages, indicating the number of subjects in each decade. From this histogram, then, we quickly see that there are far more subjects in the 20-29 range, than each of the others. We may have come to a similar conclusion looking at the original bar chart. However, what we also see here is that the number of subject in the 30-39 range is larger and 40-49, and so on. An observation like this is not as immediately avaiable when looking at the original bar chart. 2.4.2 Numerical Summaries While looking at a graphical summary can often give us quick insight into patterns in our data, the use of numerical summaries can allow us to be much more precise. Typically with continuous data, we can reduce all of the data to a few numerical values that describe the data in detail. These include: Center Spread Skewness We look at each of these in turn 2.4.2.1 Center Numbers designed to reflect the center of a dataset are called Measures of Central Tendancy. There are three popular arithmetic measures used to caputre the center of a ((distribution)), namely Mean Median Mode Before moving onto these in detail, let‚Äôs take a moment for a brief review of Summation Notation (((Would be cool to have a div element for ‚ÄúReview‚Äù or ‚ÄúBtw‚Äù. We could also include an appendix where all of this is explained in more detail that they can click to visit, with an actual ‚Äúquick review‚Äù done here))) [[Probably ought to start with N then move to n]] In general, we will let lowercase \\(n\\) represent the total number of observations that we have collected. We can express these observations as \\[ x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n \\] where the subscript values are used to identify each observation. We can represent the sum of all of these observations using the abbreviated Sigma notation, \\[ x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\] On the right hand side, note that the value of \\(x\\) has a subscript \\(x_i\\), while the Sigma notation has \\(i=1\\) on the bottom and \\(n\\) on the top. This is to indicate that we are to go through each value of \\(i = 1, 2, \\dots, n\\), for each value of \\(x_i\\). In other words, where we might say \\(x_1\\) is the first observation, we would say that \\(x_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th observation. This is convenient when we want to describe any \\(x\\) value, but it is not important which one we choose. [[Yeah, but what do we mean by ‚Äòcenter‚Äô of a distribution?]] The mean is the most commonly used measure to find the center of a distribution. Simply enough, the mean can be found by taking the sum of all of the observations, and dividing by the total number. We can express this concisely in the following way \\[ \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n}{n} = \\frac1n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\] Note how this is similar to the Sigma summation expression above. Here, we are taking the sum of each \\(x_i\\), and then dividing this total by \\(n\\). Now, in statistics, we often talk about the mean in two different ways, which we will illustrate here. Consider, for example, the case in which we want to know the mean height of each individual living in the state of Iowa. We will present the number of people in Iowa, also known as the \\(population\\), as \\(N\\). That is, there are \\(N\\) people living in Iowa. The mean of this entire population, known as the population mean is designated by the Greek later \\(\\mu\\) (called mu). Mathematically, we would write this as \\[ \\mu = \\frac1N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i \\] Now, finding the height of each person in Iowa is likely to be very difficult, if not impossible. Often, we can get a reasonable estimate of the population mean by taking a sample of people and treating them as an approximation of the entire population. This sample will represent the actual observations we collect, and we will represent this as we did above with the lower case \\(n\\), where generally, \\(n &lt; N\\) (often by quite a bit). The sample mean, which we denote \\(\\bar{x}\\) (called x-bar), can be expressed similarly \\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac1n \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\] There are two major differences here between these two values that are worth giving a second consideration to The population mean has \\(N\\) observations, which is always larger than the \\(n\\) observations in the sample While there is only one way to select \\(N\\) observations from \\(N\\) subjects, there are many ways to select \\(n\\) observations from \\(N\\) subjects. For example, if you have five different cookies, there is only one way to select all five cookies, while there are ten different ways to select only three (I know childish example, maybe we could have a picture? Though this also introduces some benefit to non-rigorous introduction of combinations, which could be useful in explaining variance in samples?) In general, we have that \\(\\bar{x} \\approx \\mu\\), with this approximation being better the closer \\(n\\) is to \\(N\\). This is a topic we will return to shortly. Median The median, similar to the mean, is another common measure of the center of a distribution. In particular, for a set of observations, the median is an observed value that is both larger than half of the observations, as well as smaller than half of the observations. Formally, we say that the median is the 50th percentile of a dataset. Informally, we say it‚Äôs the value in the middle (I don‚Äôt like this). To find the median, we begin by arranging our data from smallest to largest. If the total number of observations, \\(n\\), is odd, then the median is simply the middle observation. If \\(n\\) is even, it is the mean of the middle two. Examples: \\(1, 2, 2, 3, {\\color{red} 5}, 7, 9, 10, 11 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Median} = 5\\) \\(1,2,2,3, {\\color{red} 5}, {\\color{red} 6}, 7, 9, 10, 11, \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\text{Median} = \\frac{(5+6)}{2} = 5.5\\) If both the mean and the median are both measures of central tendency, should we expect them to give us similar impressions about the center of a data set? [[Maybe we should have commentary on why we might be interested in center, somewhere near the beginning of this chapter. Like, maybe all of the high level ideas first, THEN do statistics and discrete/continuous plots?]] Let‚Äôs consider an example where we collect \\(n = 10\\) samples of salaries for University of Iowa employees: [[gross table for now]] $31,176 $130,000 $50,879 $37,876 $34,619 $144,600 $103,000 $48,962 $36,549 $5,075,000 With regards to salaries, we find that Mean = $569,266 Median = (48,962 + 50,879) / 2 = $49,921 Due to one extremely high salary in our observation, the median is a much better reflection of the typical UI salary. This one high salary, not representative of most of the salaries collected, is known as an outlier. From the example above, we see that the mean is highly sensitive to the presence of outliers, while the median is not. Measures that are not sensitive to outliers are known as robust, or resistant. We see, then, that the median is a robust estimator of the center of the data. [[As mentioned above, we should maybe introduce skewness earlier?]] We see above a case in which the mean and median are widely different, owing thanks to the outlier. This begs the broader question, when might we expect these measures of central tendancy to be the same, and when might we expect them to differ? Below, we consider a collection of plots illustrating common ‚Äúshapes‚Äù we might see in our data. [[Do we need discussion on mode? Skipping for now]] 2.4.3 Measures of Spread This is just getting these on paper. Serious reorganization needs to occur Suppose that we have two datasets, each with 1,000 observations, and each with both a common mean and median of 100: From the histograms above, we visually confirm that both datasets have a mean and median of 100. Despite this, however, it would appear as if these datasets are not quite as similar as one might have thought First, we see that for the first dataset, nearly all of the values fall in the range of (50, 150), while for the second dataset, this range appears to be closer to (0, 200) Recalling that each dataset has the same number of observations, it appears as if the first dataset has nearly twice as many observations near the mean value of 100 than the second dataset Suppose, then, you are approached by a researcher who wants to select a single observation from each dataset at random, and you are asked to anticipate what value that observation will have. Without having seen them, the best guess you can offer is our measure of center, which is 100. From which dataset do you suspect the random observation will have a value closer to 100? Which do you suspect will be further away? What we are observing here is two datasets with a common center that have different spread or dispersion. Next to the center, this is the second most important piece of information informing us on the shape of our data. Roughly speaking, the spread of the data informs us of the degree to which our observations tend to lie close to the center or scattered away from it. Just as we have multiple ways to determine the center of a dataset, so we have several methods for quantifying the variability of the data. These numeric summaries are known as Measures of Dispersion. Measures that we will investigate here include Variance Standard deviation Range Interquartile Range (IQR) 2.4.3.0.1 Variance and Standard Deviation In mathematical terms, we describe the variance of a dataset to be the average of the squared differences between each data value and the sample mean. The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance. [[something something clever way of inuiting what variance is]] [[https://assessingpsyche.wordpress.com/2014/07/10/two-visualizations-for-explaining-variance-explained/]] As before, consider a population with \\(N\\) observations denoted as \\[ x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N \\] To tie into our definition, note that \\((x_i - \\mu)\\) represents the difference between an observation and the population mean, while \\((x_i - \\mu)^2\\) represents the squared difference. The population variance, defined as the average of these squared differences, is denoted as \\(\\sigma^2\\), where \\[ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2 \\] The population standard deviation, being the square root of the population variance, is denoted \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\\). Like our measure for the mean, we can have both a population variance, as well as a sample variance. That is, suppose we have a sample of \\(n &lt; N\\) observations, \\[ x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n \\] The sample variance, denoted \\(s^2\\), is nearly identical to the population variance, with the exception of the fact that we now subtract the sample mean, rather than the population mean \\[ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\] Similarly, the sample standard deviation is written as the square root, \\(s = \\sqrt{s^2}\\). A few things to be on the lookout for: See that the sample variance finds the average by multiplying by \\(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\) rather than \\(\\frac1n\\). This is because there is no God, and ironically, the world is doomed to end in eternal darkness after being engulfed by our only source of light, the sun Be extra careful when finding standard deviations. It is the square root of the sum, rather than the square root of terms inside of the sum. that is, \\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2} \\not= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sqrt{(x_i - \\mu)^2} = \\ ?? \\ _{_{(\\text{mean absolute deviation})}} \\] [[Maybe we should describe high level properties of sd/var before their formulas]] As we are discussing measures of ‚Äúspread‚Äù, it is important to consider the point in our data about which the observations are dispersed. In examining the mathematical definitions of both variance and standard deviation, we see that this point is the mean, as indicated by the \\((x_i - \\mu)\\) term within the expression. Somewhat implicit in this definition [[why?]], we assume that the observations fall symmetrically on both sides of the mean. It is this assumption that gives informative value to expressions like \\(\\bar{x} \\pm s\\), which implies that an observation is just as likely to be in the interval \\((\\bar{x} - s)\\) as it is in \\((\\bar{x}+ s)\\). I bet a visual would be nice here. Another fun fact to be worked in here is that sd &gt; 0, and only equal zero when all observations are equal to the mean. This might be a good place to start? If, for example, we assume each \\(x_i = \\bar{x}\\), then we can see simultaneously how there is no variation in our data AND how this would result in zero in the expressions above. Also, SD is not robust. [[shiny app showing sd/var with symmetric/nonsymmetric and with and without outliers?]] [[appendix entry for difference and use between sd/var]] Just as we had multiple methods for determining the center of a dataset, we have multiple ways with which to determine the spread of our data. The simplest method of spread, the range, gives us the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data, computed simply as \\[ \\text{maximum value} - \\text{minimum value} \\] We may also report the range as an interval. That is, we may say that all of our observations fall in the interval \\((\\text{min val}, \\ \\text{max val})\\). The range, however, should be used with care; a single outlier in either maximum or minimum direction can give a false sense of spread for our observations. [[example]]. In other words, the range is not robust. [[Introduce quartiles, percentiles, etc.]] &lt;- this is actually done later in text. I will put it down there and we can rearrange things later. Man, this chapter is tricky As an alternative to the range, which determines the difference between the largest and smallest values, we also have the interquartile range (IQR), which determines the differnce between the 75th percentile (third quartile, Q3) and the 25th percentile (first quartile, Q1), i.e., \\[ \\text{IQR} = \\text{Q}_3 - \\text{Q}_1 \\] In other words, the IQR is the length of the interval containing the middle 50% of observations, where the smallest 25% and largest 25% are not included. As this helps protect against a handful of outliers in either direction, we have that the IQR is a robust measure of spread. [[Not sure how to nicely tie in here, but good place to note that the median is also included in this (and in fact is the center of it).]] [[May be interesting to show to histograms of data and their summaries. For one, use mean and sd, for others, use median and IQR. Compare and contrast]] 2.4.4 Percentiles and Quartiles As the data that we can collect can come in a variety of different shapes and sizes, it is important that we use tools and definitions that will mean the same thing, regardless of what the data is, or where it comes from. Often, it is useful to know how large or small an observation is, relative to all of the others. We might say, for example, ‚ÄúCaptain Public Health is the fourth tallest person in the class.‚Äù Notice how this can mean one thing if Captain Public Health is in a class of 500 students, but something entirely different were he in a class of only 5. A useful way around this is to use a concept known as a percentile, which allows us to determine where in a dataset an observation would fall relative to all other values. More precisely, the \\(p\\)th percentile is a value \\(V_p\\) such that \\(p\\%\\) of observations are below \\(V_p\\) \\((100 - p)\\%\\) of observations are greater than \\(V_p\\) [[chose to use 20 instead of ten, since I think it allows us to ‚Äúsee‚Äù observations on the other side of the percentile. If we chose 10, there would be nothing to the left of it]] Suppose, for example that we are looking for the \\(20\\)th percentile of a dataset, which we denote \\(V_{20}\\). This will be the number such that it is greater than or equal to 20% of the data, but smaller than the remaining 80%. If our sample data consisted of ten observations, \\[ 2,\\ 3,\\ 5,\\ 5\\ ,\\ 6 ,\\ 7,\\ 10,\\ 23,\\ 26,\\ 28. \\] Then the \\(20\\)th percentile would be \\(V_{20} = 3\\), as 20% of the observations \\(\\{2, \\ 3\\}\\) are less than or equal to it, while the remaining 80%, \\(\\{5,\\ 5\\ ,\\ 6 ,\\ 7,\\ 10,\\ 23,\\ 26,\\ 28 \\}\\) are greater than it. There are, however, a few difficulties that may arise with this definition. The largest of these are The sample size is too small There may be tied values The percentiles may not be unique For example, what if we had been asked to find the \\(20\\)th percentile of an altered version of the dataset above, where 3 is repeated several times? \\[ 2,\\ 3,\\ {\\color{red} 3},\\ {\\color{red} 3}\\ ,\\ 6 ,\\ 7,\\ 10,\\ 23,\\ 26,\\ 28. \\] There are a number of different methods for defining and calculating percentiles in these cases, but for the intent of this course, we will focus more on the interpretation of the percentile, rather than it‚Äôs definition. There are a number of specific percentiles that are especially useful to us. For example, we have already seen the median, which can also be referred to as the \\(50\\)th percentile of a dataset. In addition to the median, we are also often interested in determining the \\(25\\)th and \\(75\\)th percentile as well. These three percentiles make up the quartiles of the data, denoted \\[ \\begin{align*} Q_1 &amp;= 25^{th} \\text{ percentile} = 1^{st} \\text{ or lower quartile} \\\\ Q_2 &amp;= 50^{th} \\text{ percentile} = 2^{nd} \\text{quartile or median} \\\\ Q_3 &amp;= 75^{th} \\text{ percentile} = 3^{rd} \\text{ or upper quartile} \\end{align*} \\] Here is a helpful thing to note: suppose that we begin with the median \\(M\\), such that 50% of observations are less than this value and 50% are greater than it. \\(Q_1\\) can be said to represent the median of the smaller 50% of all observations, while \\(Q_3\\) can be said to be the median of larger 50%. With some effort, I can maybe find a way to articulate this better. It is the difference between the upper and lower quartile that we define as the interquartile range, or \\(\\text{IRQ} = Q_3 - Q_1\\). [[Thinking about box plots here, used to depict information on skewness, percentiles, outliers, etc. It might be good to lead this chapter with all of the different characteristics we might want to know about (i.e., including center, spread, etc)]] [[Numeric example with UI salaries]] While it is common to report the mean and standard deviation as a two-number summary of continuous data, as we have seen in this chapter, neither of these measures are robust to extreme observations or outliers. An alternative approach, known as a five-number summary, makes use of the percentiles of the data, consisting of: (1) the minimum, (2) the first quartile, (3) the median, (4) the third quartile, (5) and the maximum. In addition to the numerical presentation of the five-number summary, we can also present important percentiles with the use of a plot. The box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is one such visual summary. In addition to information regarding the quartiles, the box plot also depicts information about skewness and the presence of outliers. [[reproduce plot from slides, which was nicely labeled]] In general, we can expect a box plot to consist of the following elements: A box, indicating the Interquartile Range (IQR), bounded by the values \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\) The median, or \\(Q_2\\), represented by the line drawn within the IQR The ‚Äúwhiskers‚Äù, extending out of the box, which can be defined in a number of ways. In the plot above, the length of the whiskers is determined to be 1.5 times the length of the IQR from either \\(Q_1\\) or \\(Q_3\\). Variations may include (but are not limited to) the minimum and maximum of the data, the length of one standard deviation above and below the mean (not median) of the data, or pre-specified percentiles in addition to those given by \\(Q_1, \\ Q_2, \\ \\text{and} \\ Q_3\\). Outliers. These are typically presented as small circles or dots, and are values in the data that are not present within the bounds set by either the box or whiskers. Box plots also allow us to determine if the distribution of the data is skewed or symmetric. We say a distribution is symmetric if the left side of the box plot is identical to the right, mirrored around the median. We say that a distribution is skewed left if the majority of the area of the box plot is on the right, and the area gradually trails off on the left. Finally, we say that a distribution is skewed right if the majority of the area for the box is on the left, gradually tailing to the right. [[Depending on how this is used in the course, I almost prefer positive and negative skew because this shit is confusing. Sort of how f(x - c) is a right shift of the plot compared to f(x)]] [[Wait, do those definitions above match what is presented in the slides for the box plots on the next page?]] [[Introduce questions to guide learning. i.e., where is median, is this skewed, are there outliers, etc]] [[ Box plots to compare multiple distributions]] [[Data presentation in the wild + common errors]] [[review]] "],
["ch3.html", "3 Study Design 3.1 All Strawberry, no Rhubarb 3.2 Asking the Question", " 3 Study Design ‚ÄúRandomization is too important to be left to chance.‚Äù - J. D. Petruccelli [[We have a scientific question, as well as statistical question, and each of these is subtly different from what we will call hypothesis in context of statistics. Should iron out how we want to use these words]] As mentioned in Chapter 1, statistics is the science that allows us to provide objective, evidenced-based answers to questions that we have about the world. Doing this effectively is tantamount to correctly establishing our inquiry within the statistical framework. Inquiry in hand, we now go about answering the three basic questions in statistics: How should I collect my data? How should I describe and summarize the data I‚Äôve collected? What does my data tell me about the way the world works? The goal of this chapter is to address the first of these questions. Formally, study design has a definition that involves the process of identifying a relevant population, collecting a representative sample, and asking our question in such a way that the answer of this little question will ultimately give us insight to the scientific question at hand. Aside: for example, if we are looking at polio vaccine, our science question may be something sciency like ‚Äúdoes this vaccine prevent polio‚Äù but that has to be translated to the statistical question, akin to ‚Äúis the incidence of polio in control group statistically different than that of the treatment group.‚Äù Maybe we should say something more about this translation process, but I don‚Äôt know enough about regular science to do so. Also, thinking something like the study design process and challenges are Sample/Population selection bias non-response bias Extrapolating sample beyond population Asking question Confounding bias Placebo bias Diagnostics and Perception bias Randomization ‚ÄúEthics‚Äù What are a few lives now for the future of all humanity? Distinction between child and adult is arbitrary Marginalized Populations: Would they even be missed? 3.1 All Strawberry, no Rhubarb Let‚Äôs begin by considering an ideal world. In such a case, the sampling stage of our study design process might look a little bit like this: We start with a list of everyone in our population of interest. Each person in this population is equally easy to sample, and the cost of each is the same We randomly sample this population Everybody sampled is eager to help the statistician answer their question, and nobody refuses to participate In such a world, we will end up with a sample of people who are representative of the population in question. In other words, anything that we learn about the sample will very likely also be true about the population (but of course, we can never be entirely certain unless we ask everybody, in which case, we are no longer doing statistics). Unfortunately, things are rarely perfect, and the consequence is that we may end up with a sample that is not representative of our population. The ways and magnitudes with which this difference exists are known as sampling biases. Fortunately for us, the most common imperfections occur in rather predictable ways. Broadly speaking, the two most common forms of sampling bias are selection bias and non-response bias. 3.1.1 Selection Bias First and foremost, we want to be sure that the individuals that we decide to include in our sample are representative of the population we wish to study. [[Maybe we can have a richer definition of representative above]]. Often what we find is that a given population has a number of sub-populations that make it up. For example, if a given population is 75% female and 25% male, a representative sample population should also be about 75% female and 25% male. Or maybe instead let‚Äôs consider a real-world example. The year was 1936, and the United States was still in the midsts of the Great Depression, with nine million people unemployed and real income only two-thirds of it‚Äôs 1929 equivalent. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was just completing his first term of office of president, and was up for re-election against Republican candidate Alfred Landon. Roosevelt and Landon had different views about how active the government should be in enacting policies to bring the country out of the depression. The Literary Digest magazine had a custom of anticipating the outcome of the election, having successfully predicted the winner in every presidential election since 1916. Having collected samples from 2.4 million people for the upcoming 1936 election, the Digest predicted a landslide victory for Landon: 57% to 43%. The actual election was a landslide indeed, but the victory was to Roosevelt, having collected 62% of the vote to Landon‚Äôs 38%. Having had such an enormous sample [[can we mention relationship of size and variability?]], how could this poll have been so incredibly far off? In conducting it‚Äôs poll, the Digest mailed 10 million questionnaires to addresses that it had collected from telephone books and club membership rosters. At a time when only one in four households owned a telephone, and club membership was a luxury few could afford, the Digest inadvertently tended to screen out of their survey those who were poor. In other words, the sample selected was disproportionately wealthy, resulting in a classic case of selection bias. Slides mention 10 million surveys and only 2.4 responses, but we don‚Äôt have any information on the non-response bias other than the fact that some didn‚Äôt respond. A similar thing happened in the 1948 election with Thomas Dewey vs Harry Truman 3.1.2 Non-response Bias In the previous example, we noted that 10 million questionnaires had been sent out, but only 2.4 million responses were returned. While it would certainly be nice if everybody complied with our requests for information, it is often unrealistic to expect that each inquiry will be returned. In and of itself, this is not a problem. Indeed, so long as non-response is random and the samples collected continue to be representative of the population, our sample population will still be valid [[can we mention size/variability? Maybe hint at it? Say something w/o defending it, hoping nobody asks?]]. However, what if non-response is not random? In other words, what happens if one sub-group of the population is more likely to respond to a survey than another? In 2017, the University of Iowa conducted the Speak Out Iowa campus climate survey as part of a comprehensive strategy to respond to sexual misconduct, dating violence, and stalking on our campus. All degree-seeking, undergraduate, graduate, and professional students (N=30,458) at the Iowa City and off-campus centers, including those completing online degrees, received an invitation to participate in the Speak Out Iowa survey through an email message sent to their university email address. A total of 6,952 students completed the survey, and of those, 68% identified as female, while 32% identified as male. Damn. There aren‚Äôt conclusions here. Having written it out, I see why this was left as a question at the end. Ok, we can still do that, but I think we should also investigate another non-response bias 3.1.3 False Generalization Bias / Extrapolation Bias What do we call this section? The previous two examples demonstarted ways in which we might incorrectly move from a target population to a non-representative sample. This final case describes movement in the opposite direction: from a specified sample to a more general population. Nonetheless, the cause of the bias is the same. The motivation here can be most readily illustrated by considering the issue of pharmaceutical trails and the use of children. For practical, ethical, and economic reasons, clinical trials usually only involve adults - indeed, only about 25% of drugs are subjected to pediatric studies. Physicians, however, are allowed to use any FDA-approved drug in any way that they think is beneficial are are not required to inform parents if the therapy has not been tested on children. By way of example, we consider here the drug propofol, a sedative that has consistently proven safe for use in adults. In 1992, however, after several children who received propofol in the ICU died, the British government recommended against using it on patients under the age of 16. Despite this recommendation, propofol continued to be widely used in the U.S.. It wasn‚Äôt until 2001 that the manufacturers of propofol conducted a randomized, controlled trial, finding that 9.5% of children on propofol died, compared with 3.8% of children on a different sedative. Although the FDA has now added a warning indicating this, the administration of propofol to children in the ICU is still legal, and subject to controversy. As we can see, the safety of propofol, which had been consistently demonstrated to be effective in adults, failed to generalize to the wider population, which in this case included children under the age of 16. 3.2 Asking the Question I think it would be useful here and in other sections to start off with an advance organizer. In other words, let‚Äôs begin by telling them We are going to look at what we are doing here (asking question) We are going to look at the correct way to do it We are going to look at why we do it this way (random assignment - confounding, double blind - placebo) We are going to look at other ways this can go wrong (matching - confounding). So far, we have identified ways in which the sampling portion of our study can introduce bias, and we now turn our attention to the questions themselves. More specifically, we concern ourselves here with the idea of ‚Äúare we correctly answering the question we are meaning to ask?‚Äù Often in medical studies and biostatistics, we concern ourselves with a new treatment or therapy, and the question of interest is ‚Äúis this effective?‚Äù This further begs the question ‚Äúeffective relative to what?‚Äù Often the only meaningful way to answer this is to compare treatment or therapy to something else. Consequently, we find ourselves with two groups: The treatment group, representing the subjects receiving the therapy The control group, or those subjects who are not treated Just as we had to exercise caution is selecting a sample from the population, so must we be careful to appropriately allocate subjects to the groups. At a minimum, our experiment should conform to the following guidelines: Subjects should be assigned to treatment or control groups at random The experiment should be double blinded So far, our general process looks like this [[Illustration]] Population -&gt; Sample -&gt; (Treatment, Control) -&gt; experiment something something something something 3.2.1 Confounding In 1916, a polio epidemic hit the United States, resulting in hundreds of thousands of people, especially children, falling victim to the disease over the next forty years. By the 1950s, several vaccines had been developed. One in particular, developed by Jonas Salk, seemed especially promising based on laboratory studies. In 1954, the Public Health Service organized an experiment to see whether the Salk vaccine would protect children from polio outside of the laboratory. Two million children were selected from the most vulnerable age groups, aged 6 to 9. Of these children, some were vaccinated, some refused treatment, and some were deliberately left unvaccinated. This, of course, raises the issue of medical ethics, which are always a consideration in medical studies: is it ethical to deliberately leave some children unvaccinated? In other words, as some families ultimately chose to refuse vaccination, would a more ethical design not offer the vaccine to all children, leaving those who refused to serve as controls? Thinking back to some of the issues raised at the beginning of this chapter, what are some issues that could arise in letting the subjects determine their group assignment? Would we expect the treatment and control groups to both still be representative samples of our population? Or is it possible that that these groups might be different in important ways? [[I need to consider past/present tense here, and in general]] As it turns out, higher-income parents were generally more likely to consent to treatment, and their children were more likely to suffer from polio. The reason for this latter point is that children from poorer backgrounds were more likely to contract mild cases of polio early in childhood, while still protected by antibodies from their mothers. Consequently, the difference in infection between the treatment and control groups could possibly have been related to parental income, rather than treatment. Family background here is said to be a confounding factor, a frequent and potentially major source of bias. A confounder, also known as a lurking variable, is a third variable which is related to both exposure and outcome. Because of this relationship, confounders distort the observed relationship between exposure and outcome. [[Image]] In the case of the polio example, then, we have the following pieces from the diagram above Exposure = whether the child gets the vaccine or not Outcome = whether the child gets polio or not Confounder = child‚Äôs socioeconomic status Example 2 Many epidemiologic studies have shown that coffee drinkers have an increased risk of lung cancer. However, researchers also noticed that smokers are more likely to drink coffee [[Image]] Once researchers controlled for smoking status, they no longer found a change in lung cancer risk due to drinking coffee While there are many complicated analysis techniques that exist to control for confounding, matching is a technique used in the study design process, which can be done at either the individual or the group level. In a matched study at the individual level, for each subject in the treatment group, a subject matching on potentially confounding variables is also placed. For example, age and sex are both common confounders. If, during the process of enrolling patients, a 40 year old male is assigned to the treatment group, the next 40 year old male would then be assigned to the control, or placebo, group. When used at the group level, matching seeks to ensure that the distributions of the counfoundning variables are the same in each group. Consider again the coffee/cancer example, matching at the group level would ensure that a similar proportion of smokers are included in the coffee drinking group as in the non-coffee drinking group. library(tippy) ## Registered S3 method overwritten by &#39;htmlwidgets&#39;: ## method from ## print.htmlwidget tools:rstudio tippy(&quot;Hover me!&quot;, tooltip = &quot;Hi, I&#39;m the tooltip!&quot;) Here is a "],

Consider heating a pan, throwing on 10 corn kernels, and figuring out how many have popped after certain number of time. Pretend 3 minutes is 50%. Well, have them do ten for 3 minutes, then count how many popped. Repeat. 4.2 Understanding Randomness If statistics is the science of uncertainty, then probability is the mechanism that allows us to quantify our uncertainty. People talk loosely about probability all the time. For example, what‚Äôs the chance of rain tomorrow?\" or ‚Äúhow likely is it that drug A is better than drug B?‚Äù However, for scientific purposes, we need to be more specific in terms of defining and using probabilities. First let‚Äôs introduce some definitions to help us talk about randomness and probability. First, a random process is any act or process that results in an outcome that cannot be predicted with certainty. The sample space of a random process is the set of all its possible outcomes and is often denoted \\(\\mathcal{S}\\). Finally, an event is am outcome or collection of outcomes from a random process, and it is a subset of the sample space. Suppose we flip a fair coin three times. Each act of flipping the coin is random process - the coin might land on heads and it might land on tails. Letting \\(H\\) be shorthand for the flip resulting in heads and \\(T\\) be shorthand for the flip resulting in tails, the sample space can be enumerated as \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT\\}\\), so there are eight possible results from the eight coin flips. There are several events we could describe based on this experiments, The event of obtaining exactly two heads: \\(\\{HHT, HTH, THH\\}\\) The event of obtaining heads on the first toss: \\(\\{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT\\}\\) The event of obtaining three tails \\(\\{TTT\\}\\) We would all agree that the probability of heads when flipping a fair coin is 50% and the probability of rolling a 2 on a 6-sided die is 1/6, but why is that true? Well, if we were to flip a coin many, many times, we would expect half of the flips to result in heads. Similarly, if we roll a 6-sided die over and over, 1/6 of the rolls should result in a value of 2. In both cases, we are thinking about a long-run frequency, which is why probability is defined as the fraction of time an event occurs if a random process is repeated over and over again under the same conditions. This means that probabilities are always between 0 and 1, since we can never observed more events than the number of times the process is repeated, e.g.¬†we can never observed 12 heads on 10 coin flips. Clearly, an event with probability 0 is an event that can never occur. This leads us to some important properties of probabilities: The sum of probabilities for all outcomes in the sample space, \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), must equal 1 For any event, the probability of that event is the sum of the probabilities for all the outcomes in that event For the coin flipping example, there are eight possible outcomes. Since each outcome is equally likely (why?) The first property tells us that the probability of any specific outcome (say, \\(HHH\\)) is 1/8. The second tells us that the probability of heads on the first toss is \\(4/8 = 1/2\\), since four of the outcomes. These properties underlie a lot of the more complicated formulas and concepts we will cover in this chapter, although we don‚Äôt always think about them explicitly. We can explore this concept of long-run frequency more with a simulation. For this simulation, we will simulate rolling a 6-sided die 100 times, recording the result of each roll, and then tabulating the proportion of rolls where we observed each side of the die. rollDie &lt;- function(nRolls, seed) { set.seed(seed) sample(1:6, nRolls, replace = TRUE) } barplot(table(rollDie(100, 1))) prop.table(table(rollDie(100, 1))) ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 0.19 0.18 0.12 0.15 0.15 0.21 As we see, with just 100 rolls, we don‚Äôt observe exactly the same proportion of rolls landing on each side of the die. The proportions are not exactly 1/6 = 16.7%, because of randomness. However, if we do 1,000,000 rolls, we see things even out: round(prop.table(table(rollDie(1e6, 1))), 3) ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 0.167 0.167 0.167 0.167 0.167 0.166 Now let users play with a similar app illustrating coin flips (or something) and have associated exercises. Maybe a plot of the proportion over time. 4.3 Probability Operations It‚Äôs easy to talk about probability of one event, i.e.¬†the probability of rolling a 2, but often we are interested in quantifying probabilities about more complicated combinations of multiple events. For example, if we consider a family with two parents and one child, instead of the probability of one parent getting the flu, we might be interested in the probability that both parents get the flu. Or we might be interested in the probability anyone in the family gets the flu. Finally, we might want to quantify the probability that one parent gets the flu and the other does not. In order to succinctly describe these probabilities, we use some mathematical notation. Before you get totally scared, this notation is just to simplify the writing of probability statements - the underlying concept does not change! Probabilities are denoted as \\(P(Event)\\), as in \\(P(Heads) = 0.5\\). To make things even shorter we can use a capital letter to denote an event of interest, i.e.¬†let \\(H\\) be the event that the outcome of a fair coin flip is heads, then we have \\(P(H) = 0.5\\). Then, to talk about relationships between events, we define the operations of the intersection, union, and complement. Consider to arbitrary events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): The intersection represents the event that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur and is denoted \\(A \\cap B\\) The union represents the event that \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) occur and is denoted \\(A \\cup B\\) The complement represents the scenario that event does not occur, the complement of \\(A\\) is denoted as \\(A^C\\) In the previous coin tossing example, define \\(A = \\text{obtaining exactly two heads} = \\{HHT, HTH, THH\\}\\) and \\(B = \\text{obtaining heads on the first toss} = \\{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT\\}\\). \\(A \\cap B = \\text{obtaining exactly two heads AND a heads on the first toss} = \\{HHT, HTH\\}\\) \\(A \\cup B = \\text{obtaining exactly two heads OR a heads on the first toss}= \\{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH\\}\\) \\(B^C = \\text{obtaining tails on the first toss} = \\{TTH, THT, THH, TTT\\}\\) We can visualize these operations with Venn diagrams. A Venn diagram uses overlapping circles and shading to describe the relationship between two events. First, we will visualize the intersection operation. If the left circle denotes the event \\(A\\) and the right circle denotes the event \\(B\\), then the intersection is the overlapping region where both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur. Figure 4.1: Venn diagram of intersection The union operation includes all outcomes in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) (or both), so it would include the entire region. Figure 4.2: Venn diagram of union The complement of \\(B\\), includes all outcomes that are not part of event \\(B\\). Figure 4.3: Venn diagram of the complement of B Since the probability of all outcomes in the sample space must add to 1, and the complement Back to the flu example, let \\(A\\) denote the event that one parent gets the flu, let \\(B\\) denote the event that the other parent gets the flu, and let \\(C\\) denote the event that the child gets the flu. Using this new notation, we can represent the probability that both parents get the flu as \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) , the probability that anyone in the family gets the flu as \\(P(A \\cup B \\cup C)\\), and the probability that one parent gets the flu and the other does not as \\(P(A \\cap B^C)\\). In some cases, there is no overlap between the events, i.e.¬†the events cannot happen simultaneously. When two events cannot happen at the same time, they are said to be mutually exclusive. Mathematically, this means the \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\). For example, consider the following two events based on your final course letter grade: \\(A\\) is the event of getting an \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the event of getting a \\(B\\). As only one grade can be given per course, clearly \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive. Obtaining the probability of at least one of two mutually exclusive events happening is straightforward as there is no overlap between events. Thus, the probability of \\(A \\cup B\\) is simply the sum of the probabilities of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) happening separately. Important Formula! For mutually exclusive events: \\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\\] Figure 4.4: Venn diagram of mutually exclusive events If two events are not mutually exclusive, there is overlap in the events and \\(P(A \\cap B) \\neq 0\\) and we cannot get the probability of the union using the previous formula. If we did, we would be double counting the intersection. As a concrete illustration, suppose that for a married couple, the probability that one spouse contracts the flu (event \\(A\\)) is 0.25, the probability that the other spouse contracts the flu (event \\(B\\)) is 0.20, and the probability that both the spouses contract the flu (\\(A\\) and \\(B\\)) is 0.15. If we displayed this information in a Venn Diagram, we would have: Figure 4.5: Venn diagram of flu probabilities At first glance, this might not be what you would expect. If \\(P(A = 0.25)\\), why do we have \\(0.10\\) in that region? However, the event \\(A\\) is actually divided into two regions - the part that intersects \\(B\\) and the part that doesn‚Äôt. This is called the Law of Total Probability, and this means that the probability of \\(A\\) consists of both the probability that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) both happen and the probability that \\(A\\) happens but \\(B\\) doesn‚Äôt. This is true since \\(B\\) and \\(B^C\\) are mutually exclusive and together contain all possible outcomes. Mathematically, we can write this as: \\[P(A) = P(A \\cap B) + P(A \\cap B^C)\\] And in a Venn diagram this looks like: Figure 4.6: Venn diagram of the law of total probability Getting back to finding the quantity of interest, \\(P(A \\cup B)\\), what all of this means is that if two events are not mutually exclusive, then \\(P(A \\cup B) \\neq P(A) + P(B)\\), because both \\(P(A)\\) and \\(P(B)\\) include the intersection regions \\(P(A \\cap B)\\). We do want to include the intersection in the union, but only one time. So we can get the correct probability by subtracting off one of the intersections: Important formula!! In general, \\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\] This formula actually includes the mutually exclusive case, since when two events are mutually exclusive \\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\). Let‚Äôs use a coin flipping simulation to illustrate this formula with the two events of interest being obtaining exactly two heads (event \\(A\\)) and obtaining heads on the first toss (event \\(B\\)). We know there are three ways we can obtain exactly two heads, so \\(P(A) = 3/8 = 0.375\\). There are four ways we can obtain heads on the first toss, so \\(P(B) = 4/8 = 0.50\\). There are two ways we can obtain exactly two heads AND obtain heads on the first toss, so \\(P(A \\cap B) = 2/8 = 0.25\\). Finally, there are five ways we can we can obtain exactly two heads OR obtain heads on the first toss, so \\(P(A \\cup B) = 5/8 = 0.625\\). We could also find this last probability using the previous formula and the previous probabilities. \\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) = 0.375 = 0.50 - 0.25 = 0.625\\] You can decide how many simulations to run, and the app will report the proportion of simulations that results in exactly two heads, the proportion where heads was obtained on the first toss, the proportion were both events occurred simultaneously, and the proportion of where either event occurred. Since probabilities are defined as long run frequencies, if enough simulations are run, these proportions should be identical to the probabilities defined previously. flipCoin3 &lt;- function() { dat &lt;- rbinom(3, 1, 0.5) event1 &lt;- sum(dat) == 2 event2 &lt;- dat[1] == 1 intersectionProb &lt;- event1 &amp; event2 unionProb &lt;- event1 | event2 c(event1, event2, intersectionProb, unionProb) } nSims &lt;- 1000 simRes &lt;- replicate(nSims, flipCoin3()) cbind(c(&#39;P(A)&#39;, &#39;P(B)&#39;, &#39;P(A AND B)&#39;, &#39;P(A OR B)&#39;), rowMeans(simRes)) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;P(A)&quot; &quot;0.373&quot; ## [2,] &quot;P(B)&quot; &quot;0.507&quot; ## [3,] &quot;P(A AND B)&quot; &quot;0.251&quot; ## [4,] &quot;P(A OR B)&quot; &quot;0.629&quot; We can run a similar experiment, but now using two mutually exclusive events - the event of obtaining exactly two heads, and the event of obtaining three tails. flipCoin3 &lt;- function() { dat &lt;- rbinom(3, 1, 0.5) event1 &lt;- sum(dat) == 2 event2 &lt;- sum(dat) == 0 intersectionProb &lt;- event1 &amp; event2 unionProb &lt;- event1 | event2 c(event1, event2, intersectionProb, unionProb) } nSims &lt;- 1000 simRes &lt;- replicate(nSims, flipCoin3()) cbind(c(&#39;P(A)&#39;, &#39;P(B)&#39;, &#39;P(A AND B)&#39;, &#39;P(A OR B)&#39;), rowMeans(simRes)) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;P(A)&quot; &quot;0.361&quot; ## [2,] &quot;P(B)&quot; &quot;0.124&quot; ## [3,] &quot;P(A AND B)&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## [4,] &quot;P(A OR B)&quot; &quot;0.485&quot; No matter how many times we repeat the experiment, the intersection is always 0, because we can never flip a coin three times and get exactly two heads and three tails. 4.4 Conditional Probability Many times we are interested in the probability of an event occurring, given that another event has occurred, such as ‚ÄúWhat is the probability of an individual getting lung cancer, given that they are a smoker?‚Äù If we didn‚Äôt know if the individual was a smoker or not, we would probably guess the probability of lung cancer is pretty low, maybe 1%. Once we gain the knowledge that the individual smokes, our estimate of the probability of lung cancer increases, maybe up to 20%. Conditional probability refers to the probability of one event occurring given that another event has already taken place. For events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the conditional probability that \\(B\\) will occur given that \\(A\\) has already taken place is denoted \\(P(B|A)\\). Important formula! Conditional probabilities \\[P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\] or rearranging: \\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) P(B)\\] This formulas may seem like it comes out of nowhere, but let‚Äôs see if we can understand the intuition behind the math. Recall that probabilities give us the fraction of time an event occurs, when repeated over and over. Conditional probabilities are calculated assuming we already have knowledge on whether a related event has occurred. In the formula above, we are given that \\(B\\) has occurred, so the denominator includes only probabilities associated with event \\(B\\). Additionally, since we know \\(B\\) occurred, \\(A\\) can only happen in conjunction with \\(B\\), so the numerator only includes probabilities associated with \\(A \\cap B\\). We can also think about this concept with our coin flipping example. Consider the events \\(A\\) to be obtaining exactly two heads and \\(B\\) to be obtaining a heads on the first toss (the same events we‚Äôve previously defined as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)) \\(A = \\{HHT, HTH, THH\\}\\) \\(B = \\{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT\\}\\) If we condition on \\(B\\), that means we know that the first flip was heads. With conditional probability, \\(P(A|B)\\), we are thinking about the probability of obtaining exactly two heads on three flips, given that the first flip resulted in heads. Without knowledge of the first flip, we would have said the probability of exactly two heads is 3/8, because there are eight possible outcomes of flipping a coin three times, and three of those result in exactly two heads. After we condition on the first flip being heads, our sample space is reduced. Now, there are only four outcomes where the first of three flips results in heads. We also know that of those four outcomes, two of them result in exactly two heads: \\(B = \\{HHT, HTH\\}\\). So this conditional probability must be \\(1/2\\). Often, we are not able to enumerate all possible outcomes, which is why the formulas come in handy. In this case, if we had used the formula: \\[P(A|B) = \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\dfrac{2/8}{4/8} = 1/2\\] The idea of conditional probability allows us to talk about the very important property of independence. When an event is not affected by another event, the two events are described as independent. Mathematically, we denote this as: \\[P(A|B) = P(A)\\] In other words, knowing that \\(B\\) has occurred does not change the probability of \\(A\\) occurring. If two events are not independent, they are said to be dependent. A simple example of independent events would be each flip of a coin. Whether the last flip was heads or not does not change the probability of heads on the next flip. If we are interested in the probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously (\\(P(A \\cap B)\\)), we can use simplify the previous result based on conditional probability: \\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B) P(B) = P(A)P(B)\\] This can be a helpful formula - and we‚Äôve actually been implicitly using it when thinking about the probabilities of different outcomes from flipping a coin three times. If the probability of heads is \\(1/2\\) and each flip is independent, then the probability of getting three heads is \\[P(HHH) = (1/2)(1/2)(1/2) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8 = 12.5\\%\\] Since the probability of heads is identical to the probability of heads, this is the probability of any outcome from the three coin flips. It is important to keep in mind that independent and mutually exclusive do not mean the same thing. Consider a fair coin and a fair six-sided die and let \\(A\\) be the event of obtaining heads on one coin flip and \\(B\\) be the event of rolling a 2 on one roll. Clearly, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent, so \\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B) = (1/2)(1/6) = 1/12\\] Now consider a fair six-sided die, where even-numbered faces are blue and odd-numbered faces are red. Let \\(A\\) be the event of rolling a red face and \\(B\\) be the event of rolling a 2. \\(P(A) = 1/2)\\) and \\(P(B) = 1/6\\) as before, but \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mutually exclusive, i.e.¬†\\(P(A \\cap B) = 0\\). To determine if events are mutually exclusive or independent, there are two questions you can ask yourself: Can both events happen at the same time? Does one event give me any information about the other event? If your answer to the first question is no, then the events must be mutually exclusive. If the answer to the first question is yes, but the answer to the second question is no, then the events are independent. 4.5 Probabilities from tables (needs a different example) When discussing and interpreting probability relationships between two or more events, it is often helpful to use tables. Consider the following table of representing Japanese men aged 45-69 (1975). The entries in the table are the probabilities of outcomes for a person selected randomly from the population. library(knitr) # fill by column probs &lt;- c(0.6, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1) probsMat &lt;- matrix(NA,ncol = 3, nrow = 3) probsMat[1:2, 1:2] &lt;- probs probsMat[,3] &lt;- rowSums(probsMat, na.rm = T) probsMat[3,] &lt;- colSums(probsMat, na.rm = T) colnames(probsMat) &lt;- c(&#39;Normal Blood Pressure (N)&#39;, &#39;High Blood Pressure (H)&#39;, &#39;Total&#39;) rownames(probsMat) &lt;- c(&#39;Reasonable Weight (R)&#39;, &#39;Overweight (O)&#39;, &#39;Total&#39;) kable(probsMat, align = &#39;c&#39;) Normal Blood Pressure (N) High Blood Pressure (H) Total Reasonable Weight (R) 0.6 0.1 0.7 Overweight (O) 0.2 0.1 0.3 Total 0.8 0.2 1.0 Here we use \\(N\\) to denote the event that a man has normal blood pressure, \\(H\\) to denote the event that a man has high blood pressure, \\(R\\) to denote the event that a man is a reasonable weight, and \\(O\\) to denote the event that a man is overweight (the letters \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) were getting old). Using this table we can get probabilities of events separately, we can get the probability of intersection, union, and complements, and we can get conditional probabilities. Let‚Äôs start by finding \\(P(R)\\), or the probability of man being a reasonable weight. This includes both men that have normal blood pressure and men that have high blood pressure, but not men that are overweight. Note that the events of being a reasonable weight and being overweight are mutually exclusive, as are the events of having normal blood pressure and high blood pressure - because a man cannot be in both categories at the same time. Thus, to find \\(P(R)\\) we actually just need to look at the right hand margin of the table, \\(P(R) = 0.7\\). Because of this, \\(P(R)\\), \\(P(O)\\), \\(P(N)\\), and \\(P(H)\\) are called marginal probabilities. The inner cells of the table directly give us the intersection probabilities, \\(P(R \\cap N) = 0.6\\), \\(P(R \\cap H) = 0.1\\), \\(P(O \\cap N)=0.2\\), and \\(P(O \\cap H)=0.1\\). To get the probabilities of at least one event happening (the union), we must add up all the cells that correspond to either event - but just like before we have to be careful about double counting the intersection. Let‚Äôs consider the probability of a man being overweight or having high blood pressure (\\(P(O \\cup H)\\)). The second row of the table corresponds to a man being overweight, and using the margin we have \\(P(O) = 0.3\\), the second column corresponds to a man having high blood pressure and \\(P(H) = 0.2\\). So if we want to get the probability of being overweight or having high blood pressure, we can add those together but notice that both of those probabilities include the probability of being overweight and having high blood pressure (\\(P(O \\cap H)\\)), so we have to subtract that value. Thus, \\[P(O \\cup H) = P(O) + P(H) - P(O \\cap H) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.4\\] This is the same formula we defined previously. When the data is in a table, we could also skip this formula and just add up all the cells where either one event or the other is present. The probability of being overweight or having high blood pressure is \\(0.2 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.4\\). Either way we do it, we get the same answer and you can use whichever method makes the most sense to you. Finally, we can get conditional probabilities from the table. For example, we might be interested in the probability of having high blood pressure for overweight men, or in other words, the probability of a man having high blood pressure, given that they are overweight (\\(P(H|O)\\)). When calculation conditional probabilities from a table, we only have to focus on the part of the table that we condition on - since that information is given to us. Given that a man is overweight, we know that we are only concerned with the second row in the table as that is the only part of the table concerning overweight men. Then to get \\(P(H|O)\\) we take the ratio of the probability of men with high blood pressure out of the probability that they are overweight \\(P(H|O) = 0.1 / 0.3 = 1/3\\). Similarly, if we wanted to get the probability of being a reasonable weight blood pressure, given a man has normal blood pressure, we would get \\(P(R|N) = 0.6 / 0.8 = 0.75\\). 4.6 Bayes‚Äô Rule SHOULD PROBABLY THINK OF ANOTHER EXAMPLE We now know that conditional results allow us to incorporate already observed information into a probability calculation. However, conditional probabilities are often easier to reason through (or collect data for) in one direction or the other. For example, suppose a woman is having twins. Obviously, if she were having identical twins, the probability that the twins would be the same sex would be 1, and if her twins were fraternal, the probability would be 1/2. But what if the woman goes to the doctor, has an ultrasound performed, learns that her twins are the same sex, and wants to know the probability that her twins are identical. Both ways of looking at the probably are in terms of a conditional probability - if \\(SS\\) denotes the event that the twins are the same sex and \\(I\\) denotes the event that the twins are identical, we know \\(P(SS|I) = 1)\\) and \\(P(SS|I^C) = 1/2\\). But what we want now is \\(P(I|SS)\\), so the information we are given has changed. The tool we use to ‚Äúflip‚Äù conditional probabilities is called Bayes‚Äô rule. Important formula! Bayes‚Äô rule Consider to events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and suppose we know the following probabilities: \\(P(B|A)\\), \\(P(B|A^C)\\), \\(P(A)\\), and \\(P(A^C)\\). If want to get \\(P(A|B)\\), we can use: \\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^C)P(A^C)}\\] We can apply Bayes‚Äô rule to the woman having twins scenario, but we need to know one other piece of information: the probability that a pair of twins will be identical (\\(P(I)\\)). Since the proportion of all twins that are identical is roughly \\(1/3\\), we will say \\(P(I = 1/3)\\). Therefore, \\[\\begin{aligned} P(I|SS) &amp;= \\frac{P(SS|I)P(I)}{P(SS|I)P(I) + P(SS|I^C)P(I^C)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1 \\times \\frac{1}{3}}{(1 \\times \\frac{1}{3}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3})} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{1}{2} \\end{aligned}\\] Let‚Äôs think about what happened. Before the ultrasound, the probability that the twins were identical, \\(P(I)\\), was \\(1/3\\). This is called the prior probability. After we learned the results of the ultrasound, the probability that the twins were identical, \\(P(I|SS)\\), is \\(1/2\\). This is called the posterior probability. In fact, this prior/posterior way of thinking can be used to establish an entire statistical framework rather different in philosophy than the one we have presented so far in this course. In this way of thinking, we start out with the idea of the possible values of some unknown facet of the world \\(\\theta\\). This distribution of possibilities \\(P(\\theta)\\) is our prior belief about the unknown; then we observe data \\(D\\) and update those beliefs, arriving at our posterior beliefs about the unknown \\(P(\\theta|D)\\). Mathematically, this updating is derived from Bayes‚Äô rule, hence the name for this line of inferential reasoning: Bayesian statistics. One clear advantage of Bayesian statistics is that it is a much more natural representation of human thought. Instead of thinking about the proportion of times an event would occur if it was repeated over and over, we think about the belief it will occur given all of the available information. For something like the outcome of a sports match or the weather this is more intuitive, since the game in only played once and as we are not stuck in the movie Groundhog‚Äôs Day, we can not experience a day over and over and record the fraction of times that it rains. However, the scientific community has not widely embraced the notion of subjective beliefs as the basis for science; the long-run frequency approach that we will cover in this course has generally proved more marketable. Bayesian statistics is certainly worth being aware of and is widely used and accepted in many fields. A common application of Bayes‚Äô rule in biostatistics is in the area of diagnostic testing and routine screening, and this is the main application of Bayes‚Äô rule we will focus on. For example, older women in the United States are recommended to undergo routine X-rays of breast tissue (mammograms) to look for cancer. Even though the vast majority of women will not have developed breast cancer in the year or two since their last mammogram, this routine screening is believed to save lives by catching cancer while it is relatively treatable. The application of a diagnostic to asympotmatic individuals in the hopes of catching a disease in its early stages is called screening. Note that this is different than someone experiencing flu-like symptoms and going to the doctor to get a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT). First let‚Äôs think about what characteristics would make a good screening test. Given the following cross-classification table of test results vs.¬†true disease status, do you think this would be a good screening test for diabetes? THERES A TABLE HERE THAT WONT SHOW UP When creating a good screening test, we want to correctly classify as many individuals with and without the disease as we can. This means if an individual truly has diabetes, we would want a positive test result and if an individual does not have diabetes, we would want a negative test result as often as possible. Another way of looking at it, is that we want to minimize the errors. We want to minimize the number of truly diabetic individuals that get a negative test result, as these individuals would then be missing out on the proper treatment. Similarly, we want to minimize the number of healthy individuals that receive a positive test, as these individuals could potentially get a treatment they don‚Äôt need. Which type of error is more important depends on the context of the disease and the potential treatment, although most often people are concerned with correctly classifying the individuals with the disease. We can talk about these events in terms of conditional probabilities. Consider an individual selected at random from a certain population who is administered a screening test. Define the following events: \\[\\begin{aligned} D &amp;= \\text{the individual has the disease} \\\\ D^C &amp;= \\text{the individual does not have the disease} \\\\ T^+ &amp;= \\text{the individual has a positive test result} \\\\ T^- &amp;= \\text{the individual has a negative test result} \\end{aligned}\\] Then, to assess how well a screening test performs, we consider two important conditional probabilities. Sensitivity is the probability of obtaining a positive test result, given that the individual has the disease: \\[\\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+|D)\\] Specificity is the probability of obtaining a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease: \\[\\text{Specificity} = P(T^-|D^C)\\] Sensitivity and specificity are both concerned with correctly classifying individuals, so ideally, both the sensitivity and specificity of a screening test would equal 1. However, diagnostic tests are not perfect, so there is always some misclassification. This leads us to two other conditional probabilities, which are directly related to sensitivity and specificity.A false positive occurs when a positive test result is obtained for an individual who does not have the disease: \\[\\text{False Positive} = P(T^+|D^C) = 1 - P(T^-|D^C) = 1 - \\text{Specificity}\\] A false negative occurs when a negative test result is obtained for an individual that has the disease: \\[\\text{False Negative} = P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - \\text{Sensitivity}\\] Here we are using the rule of conditional probability \\(P(A^C) = 1 - P(A)\\) applied to conditional probabilities. In words, once we condition on the disease status the test result can only be positive or negative and since those are the only two events in the sample space the probability of both occurring must add up to 1. The previously defined quantities are all characteristics of the screening test, i.e.¬†the probability of testing positive or negative given a certain disease status. Often, what is of more interest is the disease characteristics, conditional on the screening test results. In other words, we are interested in the probability of having the disease, given a positive test or the probability of not having the disease given a negative test. These two quantities are called the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) and can be calculated from the sensitivity and specificity using Bayes‚Äô rule. Both the PPV and the NPV can be written in terms of the test‚Äôs sensitivity, specificity, and disease prevalence \\[\\begin{aligned} PPV &amp;= P(D|T^{+}) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^C)P(D^C)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\text{Sens}\\times \\text{Prev}}{\\text{Sens}\\times \\text{Prev} + (1 - \\text{Spec}) (1-\\text{Prev})} \\end{aligned} \\begin{aligned} NPV &amp;= P(D^C|T^{-}) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{P(T^-|D^C)P(D^C)}{P(T^-|D^C)P(D^C) + P(T^-|D)P(D)} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\text{Spec}(1-\\text{Prev})}{\\text{Spec}(1-\\text{Prev}) + (1 - \\text{Sens}) \\text{Prev}} \\end{aligned}\\] Need to add that we only use prevalence in the case of screenings. If you have symptoms than we have a different prior on the probability of you having the disease. "],

The idea of a random process can apply to most everything in our lives, from the exact amount of time it takes to go from home to class, to determining the winner of a football game. Further, recall that a random process is defined by the collection of possible events and their associated probabilities, [framed in terms of long run frequencies (discuss?)]. In the coin flipping example, where the coin was flipped three times, the collection of possible events was \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT\\}\\), and the associated probabilities for the number of heads were: ## Why does this need cbind? knitr::kable(cbind.data.frame(&#39;# Heads&#39; = 0:3, &#39;Probability&#39; = c(&#39;1/8&#39;, &#39;3/8&#39;, &#39;3/8&#39;, &#39;1/8&#39;)), align = &#39;c&#39;) # Heads Probability 0 1/8 1 3/8 2 3/8 3 1/8 After determining all of the possible events, we were able to determine probabilities by tabulating the number of ways each event could occur and dividing by the total number of possibilities (in this case, eight). Of course, this can quickly become cumbersome in general: if three flips resulted in eight possible events, and four flips would result in sixteen, imagine trying to determine all of the possible outcomes of flipping a coin fifty times! Clearly, we need a more efficient way to do this. [I wrote this when it was two. Not sure if we should keep or not, or reword] Further, suppose we were asked to anticipate the number of heads that would occur after three flips. The table above would lead us to conclude that our best guess would be two or three, as it has twice the probability of either of the other outcomes. In other words, the distribution of outcomes is not completely random: there appear to be some structure in the ways these outcomes unfold. This, along with the need for a more precise way of determining possible outcomes and probabilities, leads us to the topic of the current chapter. 5.1 Introduction to Probability Distributions Put simply, a probability distribution is a function that takes a possible event as input, and gives us the resulting probability as output. -In the last chapter, we discussed random processes, events, and probability. We noted that probability is framed in terms of long-run frequencies, or the fraction of time an event occurs if a random processes is repeated over and over. One example we looked at was flipping a coin three times and we were able to determine probabilities for specific events by tabulating the number of ways the event could occur and dividing by the number of possible outcomes of flipping the coin three times. This is a feasible approach when there are not very many possible outcomes, but otherwise can be quite cumbersome. Imagine trying to tabulate all the possible outcomes of flipping a coin 50 times! Yeah, we don&#39;t want to imagine that either. This is where the genius of probability distributions comes to our rescue. A **probability distribution** is a function that describes the probability of all possible outcomes for an experiment. The input to the function is the outcome of interest, and the output is the probability of observing that outcome. Probability distributions typically have one or two **parameters**, which describe the distribution. In the coin flipping example, the parameter would be the number of flips. -Before we get to some of the most commonly used probability distributions and the pre-defined functions, we will illustrate the concept by deriving a probability distribution for our toy example. Before we get to some of the most commonly used distributions, let‚Äôs illustrate the concept by formally deriving a probability distribution for our example above. Suppose the experiment consists of flipping a coin three times and recording the number of heads. We will let \\(X\\) denote the number of heads that appear. We know that the possible values \\(X\\) can take on are \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\), since we can‚Äôt see more heads than we have flips, and we can‚Äôt have less than zero. As we saw in the previous chapter, there are eight possible outcomes and the sample space for this experiment is \\(\\mathcal{S} = \\{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT\\}\\). For each of these possible outcomes, we can count the number of heads - \\(\\{3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0\\}\\). To find the probability distribution, we calculate the probability that \\(X\\) takes on each possible value library(knitr) tmpTab &lt;- cbind.data.frame(x = 0:3, &#39;P(X=x)&#39; = c(&#39;1/8&#39;, &#39;3/8&#39;, &#39;3/8&#39;, &#39;1/8&#39;)) kable(tmpTab, align = &#39;c&#39;) x P(X=x) 0 1/8 1 3/8 2 3/8 3 1/8 Since there is one possible event where 0 heads were obtained out of the eight possible events, \\(P(X = 0) = 1/8\\). Similarly, there are three possible events where 1 head was obtained, so \\(P(X = 1) = 3/8\\). If we were to plot this probability distribution, it would look like this x &lt;- 0:3 y &lt;- dbinom(x, 3, 0.5) barplot(y, names.arg = x, xlab = &#39;Number of Heads Observed on Three Flips&#39;, ylab = &#39;Probability&#39;) We can also think about these probabilities from a simulation perspective. In this case, we are repeating the experiment of flipping the coin 3 times over and over. So to examine these probabilities from a simulation, we must simulate flipping three coins repeatedly, each time recording the total number of heads observed out of the three flips. If we do enough simulations, we should see the proportion of times each number of heads occurs follows the probability distribution we just calculated. flipCoin3 &lt;- function() { dat &lt;- rbinom(3, 1, 0.5) sum(dat) } nSims &lt;- 1000 simRes &lt;- replicate(nSims, flipCoin3()) prop.table(table(simRes)) ## simRes ## 0 1 2 3 ## 0.121 0.373 0.387 0.119 The last thing we need to know about probability distributions is that there are two types, discrete and continuous. This is a little different than the types of data discussed in Chapter 2 (categorical or continuous). Discrete distributions calculate probabilities for specific numeric values (most often counts). The coin flipping example we just looked at was a discrete distribution, because there were four distinct possibilities of the number of heads we could observe. On the other hand, Continuous distributions, describe probabilities over a continuum with a smooth curve. For continuous distributions, probabilities are described by the area under the curve. 5.2 Binomial Distribution The first distribution we will cover is the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution is a discrete distribution which describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials with two outcomes. Often, the outcomes are referred to as success and failure, although this can be a little confusing in biomedical trials where a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù might be an adverse reaction to a new drug or something even worse. To avoid this confusion, we will instead consider the outcome as either an event or a non-event. There are three assumptions of the binomial distribution: There is fixed number of trials, \\(n\\), each of which has two possible outcomes Each trial is independent of the others Each trial has the same probability of an event occurring If \\(X\\) describes an event with a binomial distribution, we write \\(X \\sim Bin(n, p)\\). \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) are the two parameters of the binomial distribution, where \\(n\\) is the number of trials and \\(p\\) is the probability of the event occurring. The probability distribution function is described by the following formula: \\[P(X = x) = \\binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}\\] and the possible values of \\(x\\) are 0, 1, ‚Ä¶, \\(n\\). The coin flipping example was an example of the binomial distribution, where \\(n = 3\\) and \\(p = 0.5\\). 5.3 Normal Distribution "],

Ideas to make things interesting - The Wall TV show. 6.1 Sampling Distributions Definition Population Parameter: The true numeric quantity about a population Suppose policy makers and public health experts in Iowa are concerned with Iowan‚Äôs fast food intake. To understand this further, the officials want to determine the average monthly spending on fast food for all Iowans. However, it would be very expensive and costly to have all 3.2 million Iowans track and report their total monthly spending on fast food. And certainly many Iowans would not be willing to share personal financial details with public health researchers or government officials. This means it is impossible for the officials to know the true mean amount of money that Iowans spend on fast food each month. The true numeric quantity about the population, such as this, is known as a population parameter. While we will never ever know the truth, there are still options. The officials can take a sample of Iowans and have those that consent to share their information report their monthly spending on fast food. Then, they can take the sample mean, which gives them an estimate of the average monthly spending on fast food. The sample mean is an example of a sample statistic, which is a numerical quantity about the sample. In other words, statistics are what investigators know, and parameters are what investigators want to know. The statistical framework allows us to make inference about population parameters using sample statistics. This means the researchers can use a random sample of Iowans‚Äô monthly fast food spending to make generalizations about the average monthly spending for all Iowans. Figure 6.1: Statistical Framework We also want to know whether or not our estimated statistic is measuring the parameter well. To that end, there are two major issues we concern ourselves with: * On average, does our estimate tend to be centered around the true answer, or is it biased? * How much variability is there likely to be in our sample? The difference between our estimate and our parameter is called bias. Variance describes the spread of our data (I DON\"T LIKE THIS DEFINITION), and is sometimes called noise. Sometimes we talk about spread in terms of precision, which is the inverse of variance. The more precision we have, the less variance, and vice versa. For some reason, it doesn‚Äôt like pdfs, and it doesn‚Äôt like `out.width=‚Äú0.75\\linewidth‚Äù‚Äô Figure 6.2: Some cool caption PRACTICE SAFE STATISTICS Don‚Äôt drink and derive In order to make inference, we must be able to quantify our uncertainty about the population parameter. As we will see later in this chapter, this uncertainty depends on how many individuals we sample and how variable the data we measure is. In our statistical framework, there is some unknown population parameter which we estimate with a sample statistic. In the fast food example, the parameter of interest was a population mean and the sample statistic was the sample mean. In this chapter, we will specifically focusing on estimating means, however, there are other possible numerical quantities we could describe - proportions, standard deviations, etc. . Any time we take a sample from the population, we will get a different sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\). In other words, \\(\\bar{x}\\) is a numeric quantity which assumes a value based on the outcome of a random experiment - the process of drawing a sample at random from the population. This should sound familiar to you - this is the definition of a random variable! We can use this logic for any statistic of interest. As we‚Äôve described in the past, random variables have probability distributions. When the random variable is a statistic, this probability distribution is called the sampling distribution. Sampling distributions reflect which values of the statistic are likely and which values are improbable. A VISUALIZATION ABOUT SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD BE COOL HERE. SOMETHING THAT SHOWS ALL THE UNITS IN THE POPULATION WITH NUMERIC VALUES ON THEM, THEN TAKE SAMPLE AND CALCULATE MEAN. I think what would be neat is doing dot plots for a population and have them be all one color, say, red. Once the samples are chosen, they will be presented below with their own distribution in blue. BUT! The ones selected in the random sample would also turn blue, indicating that they were picked. Maybe this is like what that shiny app you showed me was? As we‚Äôve seen earlier in this book, we will use upper-case letters to denote random variables, and lower-case letters to denote possible values they can take on. When it comes to the sampling distribution of the mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the random variable, which arises from repeated random sampling from the population and then taking a sample mean, and \\(\\bar{x}\\) is an observed sample mean we might see. In describing a sampling distribution, we are often interested in the mean and standard deviation - this gives information about typical values the statistic might take on as well as how spread out the distribution is. We refer to the mean of a statistic as the expected value and the standard deviation as the standard error. For the random variable describing the sample mean, these are denoted as \\(E(\\bar{X})\\) and \\(SE(\\bar{X}) = \\sqrt{Var(\\bar{X})}\\), respectively. Another good way to address the \\(\\bar{X}\\) vs \\(\\bar{x}\\) is to have something like (&amp;= isn‚Äôt making them align?) \\[ \\begin{align*} \\bar{X} &amp;= \\{\\text{Mean height of} \\textit{ Sex and the City } \\text{protagonists}\\} \\\\ \\bar{x} &amp;= \\{\\text{Mean height of Carrie and Samantha}\\} \\end{align*} \\] Example We will use the fast food scenario to motivate our sample, but for let‚Äôs assume there are only five individuals in the entire population. The monthly spending for those five individuals (rounded to the nearest dollar) is as follows: Person Monthly Spending A 8 B 22 C 22 D 36 E 50 The population mean can be found by taking the average monthly spending of these five individuals, as they are the only people in this population. This means the population mean is 27.6. Now suppose we are taking samples of three individuals from this population. There are \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\) = 10 ways we can sample three people from this population. Since this is a small population, we can enumerate all possible samples, the values we would obtain for the monthly spending in each sample, and then the sample mean monthly fast food spending for each sample: Sample Values \\(\\bar{x}\\) (A, B, C) (8, 22, 22) 17.33 (A, B, D), (A, C, D) (8, 22, 36), (8, 22, 36) 22.00 (A, B, E), (A, C, E), (B, C, D) (8, 22, 50), (8, 22, 50), (22, 22, 36) 22.00 (A, D, E), (B, C, E) (8, 36, 50), (22, 22, 50) 26.67 (B, D, E), (C, D, E) (22, 36, 50), (22, 36, 50) 36.00 One thing to note is that none of the sample means are actually equal to the population mean. This is often the case! Based on this table, we can construct the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{X}\\) for a sample of size three. Why is our sample mean often not equal to the population mean? Probability P(\\(\\bar{x}\\) = 17.33) 0.1 P(\\(\\bar{x}\\) = 22) 0.2 P(\\(\\bar{x}\\) = 26.67) 0.3 P(\\(\\bar{x}\\) = 31.33) 0.2 P(\\(\\bar{x}\\) = 36) 0.2 With this probability distribution, we can get the expected value of the sampling distribution. Whenever we think about probability, we are thinking about long-run frequencies, so when we think about the expected value, we are thinking about the average sample mean if we were to take repeated samples of size three from this population. The probability distribution indicates that if we took samples of size three from this population over and over again (say 1,000 times), we would end up with 10% with a mean of 17.33, 20% with a mean of 22, 30% with a mean of 26.67; and so on. So the expected value (average) we would observed if we kept taking samples over and over would be: (0.1 \\(\\times\\) 17.33) + (0.2 \\(\\times\\) 22) + (0.3 \\(\\times\\) 26.67) + (0.2 \\(\\times\\) 31.33) + (0.2 \\(\\times\\) 36) = 27.6 But wait! That is the population mean. This illustrates an extremely powerful property of the sample mean - the expected value of the sample mean (\\(\\bar{X}\\)) is equal to the population parameter (\\(\\mu\\))! Because of this, we say that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. While we illustrated the property with a small example, this holds regardless of the population or sample size. Important Formula! For any population distribution which can be described by a random variable \\(X\\) with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), the sample distribution of the mean based on sample of size \\(n\\) (\\(\\bar{X}_n\\)) has the following properties: The expected value of the sampling distribution is \\(\\mu\\) \\[E(\\bar{X}_n) = \\mu\\] The variance of the sampling distribution is \\[Var(\\bar{X}_n) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\] Using these formulas we are able to describe the typical value of the sample mean and how variable the sample mean is in repeated sampling. Notice that the expected value does not depend on the sample size, \\(n\\), but the variance does. This means regardless of the sample size, the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. But, as the sample size increases, the variance decreases, and we get a more precise estimate of the population mean. As we‚Äôve seen in the past, it is more common to talk about the standard deviation than the variance and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The quantity \\(\\sqrt{Var(\\bar{X}_n)} = \\sigma / n\\) is primarily called the standard error of the mean, and is denoted by \\(SE(\\bar{X}_n)\\). We use the term standard error to make it really clear that it is referencing the sampling distribution of the mean, but all standard errors could be refered to as standard deviations. Conversely, not all standard deviations could be referred to as a standard error - the term is only used in describing the distribution of the sample mean. Example Let \\(X\\) denote the resting heart rate of a randomly selected U.S. adult. Assume the distribution of resting heart rates is approximately normally distributed with mean 70 bpm and standard deviation of 5 bpm. Suppose we sample 50 adults. Let \\(\\bar{X}\\) denote the mean resting heart rate of these 50 adults. What is the mean of \\(\\bar{X}\\)? (That is, in repeated sampling, what would be the average value of \\(\\bar{X}\\)?) What is the standard error of \\(\\bar{X}\\) "],

Let‚Äôs take a step back quickly and remind ourselves of the goal of a statistical analysis. There is some population level numerical quantity we are interested in (parameter) which might be a mean or a proportion, or maybe it is something more complicated. Because we can (almost) never measure something in the entire population, we are restricted to taking a sample. Our goal is to use the data we collect in our sample to make inference about the parameter, which is the unknown quantity of interest. In particular, we want to use probability distributions and the observed data to quantify what values of the parameter are plausible and which are not and we would like to determine if the trends we observe in our data are ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù or if it is simply a result of chance. 7.1 Confidence Intervals We will first turn our attention to parameter estimation, of which there are two general approaches. These approaches are point estimation, which is a single statistic computed from the sample data used to estimate the parameter and interval estimation which is an interval computed from the sample data formulated so we can have a high degree of confidence that the interval contains the true parameter. Point estimation is straightforward and is as simple as using the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean. While straightforward, this approach is problematic. In the last chapter we saw that every time we take a sample from a population and compute the sample mean, it changes. And we saw an example in which no matter how we took a sample, the sample mean could never possibly equal the population mean. This is because the act of taking a sample is a random process, which means that for any estimate from our sample it is highly unlikely (or straight up impossible) that we got the exact correct answer. Instead, it would be nice to have an interval that we could be reasonably confident contained the true parameter. What properties would make a good interval estimate? Well, on one hand we desire an interval that we can have a high degree of confidence that it includes the true parameter, but on the other hand, a narrow interval is much more informative. I can tell you with 100% confidence that the interval from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\) covers the true population parameter, and I don‚Äôt even need to know anything about what you‚Äôre studying or what numerical quantity is being estimated and I don‚Äôt even need any data! I‚Äôve achieved the first goal of having a high degree of confidence, but this interval is clearly not informative. I can make the interval smaller (I will need some data to do that), but the probability that the interval contains the true parameter will decrease. As a compromise, scientists and statisticians decided that intervals with a 95% probability of containing the true parameter was a satisfactory balance between the desire for high confidence and narrow intervals. This gives way to the most common confidence interval ‚Äì the 95% confidence interval. Although we are getting a little bit ahead of ourselves here (we will have plenty of chances to calculate 95% confidence intervals). Let‚Äôs back up with some important definitions and notation. With an interval estimate, we are concerned with coverage probability, the probability that the interval contains or covers the parameter of interest. Typically, coverage probability is denoted by \\(1 - \\alpha\\). As the interval covers the parameter with probability \\(1 - \\alpha\\), the interval does not cover the parameter with probability \\(\\alpha\\) (because covering and not covering the parameter are complements and cover the entire sample space). In that sense, \\(\\alpha\\) is the probability that we are wrong. We will discuss \\(\\alpha\\) in more specific terms later in the chapter, but for now let‚Äôs just note that \\(\\alpha\\) is a small number, maybe 0.05 or 0.01. If we convert from decimal format to percentage format (multiplying by 100), we have \\(100(1 - \\alpha)\\)%, which is called the confidence level. The mathematical details of constructing a confidence interval depends on the parameter of interest and how the study was designed, and we will see various formulas for constructing confidence intervals throughout the rest of this book. In this chapter, we will focus on conceptual understanding and interpretation. To construct a \\(100(1 - \\alpha)\\)% confidence interval, we use sample data and sampling distributions as we know that sampling is a random process. For example, the Central Limit Theorem tells us the sampling distribution of the mean is normally distributed and gives us the mean and standard deviation of that distribution. Once we have a normal distribution for which we know the mean and standard deviation, we can calculate probabilistic quantities using software. It‚Äôs extremely important that we remember what is random and what the probability distribution is specifying when we are interpreting confidence intervals. The sampling distribution describes which values of the sample statistic are likely and which are not likely. The random process is drawing a sample. The population parameter is a fixed quantity ‚Äì we don‚Äôt know what it is, but it does not change. Confidence intervals are constructed from the information we do know ‚Äì the observed data from the sample. Because sampling is a random process and confidence intervals are constructed using the sample data, the confidence interval will vary from sample to sample. However, we formulate confidence intervals mathematically to ensure that the probability that the interval contains the true probability is \\(1 - \\alpha\\). And as we‚Äôve seen probabilities are long-run frequencies. So any given confidence interval may or may not cover the true parameter, but in the long run if we take samples over and over and compute a confidence interval based on the data from each sample, we are guaranteed that \\(100(1 - \\alpha)\\)% of the confidence intervals constructed will cover the truth. This is quite appealing. Let‚Äôs explore this concept further by using the following applet. CONFIDENCE INTERVAL GENERATOR APP. 7.2 Hypothesis Tests Along with parameter estimation, a cornerstone of statistical inference is significance testing. Confidence intervals allow us to construct a range of plausible values for the parameter, and significance tests allow us to determine the likelihood of a parameter taking a certain value. A hypothesis test uses sample data to assess the plausibility of each of two competing hypotheses regarding an unknown parameter (or set of parameters). A statistical hypothesis is a statement or claim about an unknown parameter. The null hypothesis generally represents what is assumed to be true before the experiment is conducted. This hypothesis is typically denoted \\(H_0\\). The alternative hypothesis represents what the investigator is interested in establishing. This hypothesis is typically denoted \\(H_A\\). Oftentimes when people refer to the ‚Äúscientific hypothesis,‚Äù this in reference to the alternative hypothesis - it is what the investigators think will happen or what they want to show. The goal of a hypothesis test is to determine which hypothesis is the most plausible - the null or the alternative. As an example, consider researchers that have developed a new drug to treat cancer. In order for the drug to be approved for use, the investigators must prove that it is more effective in treating cancer than the current gold standard treatment. To do this, the investigators gather a sample of cancer patients and randomize half of them to receive their new drug and half to receive the current treatment. Then they determine how many patients improved in both groups. In this scenario, the null hypothesis would be that the new drug and the current drug result in the same improvement. Why? Well, the null hypothesis is what is believed before the data was collected. The key is whose beliefs we are talking about. While the scientists that developed the drug most likely believe that their new drug is more effective, the rest of the scientific community remains in a state of uncertainty. The null hypothesis reflects the general beliefs of the scientific community. The alternative hypothesis in this scenario is that the drugs differ in their effectiveness on treating cancer. This is what the researchers hope to show, specifically, they hope to show that their drug is more effective, however, when the study is conducted there is no evidence in either direction, so we leave the alternative hypothesis to also encompass the possibility of the new drug being worse. In general, we can think about the null hypothesis as being the ‚Äúbaseline,‚Äù ‚Äúboring,‚Äù ‚Äúnothing to see here‚Äù hypothesis. The exact specification will depend on the study context and the type of data being measured (categorical or continuous): \\(H_0\\): the average cholesterol for hypertensive smokers‚Äô is no different than the general population \\(H_0\\): no difference between the treatment and control groups \\(H_0\\): men and women have identical probabilities of colorectal cancer \\(H_0\\): observing a ``success\" in a population is identical to flipping a coin The hypothesis testing procedure uses probability to quantify the amount of evidence against the null hypothesis. Since the null hypothesis is the baseline, we start by assuming that it is true. Then, we conduct the study and collect data to quantify the likelihood that the the null is true. The reason for this approach is rooted in the scientific method. As we introduced in Chapter 1, the scientific method has 7 steps: Ask a question Do background research Construct a hypothesis Test your hypothesis with a study or an experiment Analyze data and draw conclusions How do the results align with your hypothesis? Communicate results We are really focusing on steps 3-5. In step 3, we construct the ‚Äúscientific hypothesis‚Äù and in step 4, we test that hypothesis. In order to produce rigorous scientific results we cannot assume that the scientific hypothesis is true, as that is the goal of our study. We must assume the current state of knowledge (null hypothesis) and then if we are to prove that our hypothesis is correct, we would show that if the current knowledge was true, it would be really unlikely that our experiment would have ended up how it did. A great analogy to the concept of hypothesis testing is our judicial system. In court, the legal principle is that everyone is ‚Äúinnocent until proven guilty‚Äù and the prosecution must prove that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In many cases, there may not be definitive evidence if the defendant is actually innocent or guilty. But, if the prosecution can show that the likelihood of the accused individual being guilty is high (or equivalently, that the likelihood of the accuwsed individual being innocent is low), then the defendant will be convicted. In hypothesis testing researchers are like the prosecution and must use data to prove that the null hypothesis (current state of knowledge) is false beyond a reasonable doubt. The next several chapters will go through how we can use different types of data to quantify our evidence against the null hypothesis. With this set up in mind, we have two possible outcomes of a hypothesis test. Either we conclude that we do not have a lot of evidence against the null hypothesis, i.e.¬†the null hyptohesis looks reasonable, and we fail to reject the null or we conclude that we have enough evidence against the null and we reject the null. It is extremely important to note here that we NEVER accept the null or accept the alternative. Many people find this annoying because we can never say anything with 100% certainty. But this is exactly the point! Remember that statistics is all about quantifying our uncertainty. Think back to our drug development example. There will never ever ever be a drug that works exactly the same in every person that takes it. People are too variable and many aspects of a person‚Äôs life impacts how a drug works in their body. So it would be completely unreasonable to say that a new drug works all the time. However, there can be a drug that improves outcomes for the average person or that this drug is likely to improve outcomes in a randomly selected person who takes it. I THINK THIS EXAMPLE MIGHT BE STUPID. We can create a two by two table for the results of any hypothesis test. In the rows we have the two possible outcomes from our test - fail to reject \\(H_0\\) and reject \\(H_0\\). In the columns we have the true underlying state of nature - either \\(H_0\\) is true or false. \\[ \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \\hline &amp; \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{True State of Nature} \\\\ \\cline{2-3} Test Result &amp; $H_0$ True &amp; $H_0$ False \\\\ \\hline Fail to reject $H_0$ &amp; \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Correct\\\\ ($1 - \\alpha$)\\end{tabular} &amp; \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Incorrect\\\\ Type II Error ($\\beta$)\\end{tabular} \\\\ \\hline Reject $H_0$ &amp; \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Incorrect\\\\ Type I Error ($\\alpha$)\\end{tabular} &amp; \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Correct\\\\ $(1 - \\beta)$\\end{tabular} \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\] In the upper-left and bottom-right cells of the table we are making the correct decision based on our test. When the null hypothesis is true, failing to reject \\(H_0\\) is the correct decision and when the null hypothesis is false, rejecting \\(H_0\\) is the correct decision. However, the other two cells correspond to a mistake being made. Because statisticians are not creative, these mistakes are referred to as type 1 error and type 2 error. A type 1 error is equivalent to a false alarm or a false positive - the null hypothesis was rejected, when in fact it was true. A type 2 error can be thought of as a missed opportunity or a false negative - the null hypothesis was false, but it was not rejected. Typically, the type 1 error rate is symbolically denoted with \\(\\alpha\\) and the type 2 error rate is denoted by \\(\\beta\\) (again statisticians are not creative). If we were looking to create a good hypothesis test, we would want to minimize type 1 and type 2 errors. In other words, if we were to conduct our study over and over again and there was something to be found, we would want to reject the null hypothesis (find something) at a high rate and fail to reject the null hypothesis at a low rate. If there was truly nothing to be found, we wouldn‚Äôt want to find anything and if there is something to be found we want to find it. However, there is a tradeoff between type 1 and type 2 error. Let us illustrate this point with a simulation. In this experiment, we are looking to determine if a coin is fair, i.e.¬†the probability of heads is 50%. A type 1 error in this context would be concluding that the coin is not fair, when it actually is. A type 2 error in this context would be concluding that the coin is fair when it is actually not. We simulate flipping a coin 20 times, and you can select a cutoff for how far away from 50% the proportion of heads would need to be for you to not believe that the coin is fair. If the observer proportion of the 20 flips that result in heads is beyond your threshold, the null hypothesis will be rejected. For example, if you choose a threshold of 10%, then any experiment where there are 60% or more flips resulting in heads OR 40% or less flips resulting in heads, then the null hypothesis is rejected and the coin is determined to not be fair. In our first simulation, the coin is truly fair, i.e.¬†\\(H_0\\) is true, so we want to fail to reject \\(H_0\\). The larger we make our cutoff, the more often we fail to reject when the coin is fair. This is intuitive because we are saying that we need more evidence to reject the null hypothesis. flipCoinFair &lt;- function( cutoff) { flipRes &lt;- rbinom(20, 1, 0.5) as.numeric(abs(mean(flipRes) - 0.5) &gt;= cutoff) } tmp &lt;- replicate(1000, flipCoinFair(0.05)) mean(1-tmp) ## [1] 0.325 tmp &lt;- replicate(1000, flipCoinFair(0.1)) mean(1-tmp) ## [1] 0.769 tmp &lt;- replicate(1000, flipCoinFair(0.3)) mean(1-tmp) ## [1] 0.989 However, if the coin is actually not fair then we do want to reject the null hypothesis. But increasing our cutoff makes it less likely that we do so. flipCoinNotFair &lt;- function( cutoff) { flipRes &lt;- rbinom(20, 1, 0.7) as.numeric(abs(mean(flipRes) - 0.5) &gt;= cutoff) } tmp &lt;- replicate(1000, flipCoinNotFair(0.05)) mean(tmp) ## [1] 0.963 tmp &lt;- replicate(1000, flipCoinNotFair(0.1)) mean(tmp) ## [1] 0.777 tmp &lt;- replicate(1000, flipCoinNotFair(0.3)) mean(tmp) ## [1] 0.253 As we have seen, type I and type II errors are not independent. Changing the rejection cutoff to minimize type I errors comes at the cost of more type II errors. 7.3 P-values All hypothesis tests are based on quantifying the probability of the study results assuming the null hypothesis is true. This probability is so important that it has a special name, the p-value. In technical terms, the p-value gives the probability of obtaining results as extreme or more extreme than the ones observed in the sample, given that the null hypothesis is true. A less technical way to describe a p-value is that assuming there is truly nothing going on, what‚Äôs the chances of obtaining results similar in opposition to the null hypothesis as our study? Let‚Äôs think about this in terms of the coin flipping example. Our null hypothesis is that the coin is fair or, equivalently, that the probability of flipping a heads is 50%. If our experiment involves flipping a coin 10 times, a p-value would give us the probability of observing a proportion of heads as far away or farther away from 50% if the coin was truly fair. Clearly, even if we do have a fair coin, there‚Äôs a decent chance of getting 4/10 or 6/10 heads, but what about the chances of getting 0/10 or 10/10 heads? For this simple example, we can actually plot these probabilities. We also could actually calculate the probabilities using what we‚Äôve already learned about the binomial distribution, but we will leave those details to a later chapter. x1 &lt;- 0:4 x2 &lt;- 6:10 prob1 &lt;- 2 * pbinom(x1, 10, 0.5) prob2 &lt;- 2 * pbinom(x2 - 1, 10, 0.5, lower.tail = F) plot(x1, prob1, type = &#39;l&#39;, xlim = c(0, 10), main = &#39;P-value&#39;) lines(x2, prob2) As we can see, and what is hopefully intuitive, the further away our number of heads is, the lower the probability of observing something as extreme or more extreme assuming the coin is truly fair. If we observed 0/10 heads, the p-value is 0.0019. This means if the coin was truly fair, the probability of observing something as extreme or more extreme than 0/10 heads is 0.19%. This is pretty strong evidence that the coin is not fair. By comparison, if we observed 6 heads, the p-value would be 0.7539. If the coin was fair, we have a pretty high chance of observing something as extreme or more extreme than 6 heads - thus we don‚Äôt have evidence that the coin is not fair. If we are thinking about hypothesis testing as a court case, p-values are the way that we can quantify the evidence against the defendant. Recall, the prosecution wants to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is not innocent. So what does the scientific community consider sufficient evidence? There is a generally agreed-upon scale for interpreting p-values with regards to the strength of evidence that they represent. p-value Evidence against null 0.1 Borderline 0.05 Moderate 0.025 Substantial 0.01 Strong 0.001 Overwhelming Often, the term ‚Äústatistically significant‚Äù is used to describe p-values below 0.05, possibly with a descriptive modifier. ‚ÄúBorderline significant‚Äù (p &lt; 0.1) ‚ÄúHighly significant‚Äù (p &lt; 0.01) However, don‚Äôt let these clearly arbitrary cutoffs distract you from the main idea that p-values represent - how far off is the data from what you would expect under the null hypothesis. A p-value of 0.04 and 0.000000001 are not at all the same thing, even though both are ‚Äústatistically significant.‚Äù In general, a p-value cutoff is chosen and if a p-value below the cutoff is observed, the null hypothesis is rejected. The investigators choose this cutoff, which is equivalent to the type I error rate and thus denoted by \\(\\alpha\\), before analyzing the data. Most of the time \\(\\alpha\\) is set to 0.05, which means there is a 5% chance of a type I error (false alarm). The smaller the value of \\(\\alpha\\), the greater the ‚Äúburden of proof‚Äù required to reject the null hypothesis. \\(\\alpha\\) is also commonly called the significance level. A fundamental property of p-values is that if we use \\(p &lt; \\alpha\\) as cutoff for rejecting the null hypothesis, the type I error rate is guaranteed to be no more than \\(\\alpha\\). However, the \\(p &lt; \\alpha\\) cutoff guarantees us nothing about the type II error rate. This is because p-values are calculated assuming the null hypothesis is true, so they don‚Äôt give us any information about what to expect when the null hypothesis is false. While p-values are widely used, have a distinct purpose, and can be informative they also have a number of limitations. DO WE NEED THIS? IS THERE AN APP WE CAN DO ABOUT P_VALUE? "],

While each hypothesis test is slightly different in the mathematical details and specific hypotheses being compared, the general procedure does not change. We consider hypothesis tests to have three primary steps: Things about the population Things about the sample Relate sample things to population (make inference) Let‚Äôs dive a little deeper into each step. 8.1.1 Things about the population Before doing any calculations, we first want to make sure we can describe the research question, the parameter(s) of interest, and can concretely write the null and alternative hypotheses. 8.1.2 Things about the sample Once we set up our research question and the competing hypotheses, we can use the sample data to assess which hypothesis is more plausible. First we want to look at what we observed, i.e.¬†what are the estimates of the population parameters of interest. Then we use the sample data to calculate a p-value, which gives us the probability of observed something as extreme or more extreme than what we observed, given that the null hypothesis is true. 8.1.3 Making inference Finally, we want to use the p-value computed from the sample data to make inference about the population parameter(s). Since the p-value quantifies the likelihood of our observations given the null hypothesis is true, a low p-value indicates evidence against the null and a larger p-value does not give evidence against the null. Based on whether the null hypothesis is rejected or not, we can answer the stated research question. 8.2 Hypothesis test for a mean The first type of hypothesis test we will cover in detail is a hypothesis test for a mean. This test is used when we have one sample of continuous data, for which we feel comfortable summarizing the ‚Äútypical‚Äù value with the mean. We seek to compare that mean to some known or pre-specified value to learn something about the population. oneSampleMean &lt;- function(n, mean0, mean1, sd) { obsDat &lt;- rnorm(n, mean0, sd) hist(obsDat) abline(v = mean1, col = &#39;red&#39;, lwd = 2) } oneSampleMean(100, 5, 4, 1) twoSampleMean &lt;- function(n1, n2, mean1, mean2, sd1, sd2, plot = F) { y1 &lt;- rnorm(n1, mean1, sd1) y2 &lt;- rnorm(n2, mean2, sd2) if (plot == TRUE) { minVal &lt;- min(c(y1, y2)) - 1 maxVal &lt;- max(c(y1, y2)) + 1 ax &lt;- pretty(minVal:maxVal, n = 12) hgA &lt;- hist(y1, breaks = ax, plot = FALSE) # Save first histogram data hgB &lt;- hist(y2, breaks = ax, plot = FALSE) # Save 2nd histogram data c1 &lt;- rgb(173,216,230,max = 255, alpha = 80, names = &quot;lt.blue&quot;) c2 &lt;- rgb(255,192,203, max = 255, alpha = 80, names = &quot;lt.pink&quot;) ylimits &lt;- c(0, max(c(hgA$counts, hgB$counts))) plot(hgA, col = c1, ylim = ylimits) # Plot 1st histogram using a transparent color plot(hgB, col = c2, add = TRUE) # Add 2nd histogram using different color } c(mean(y1), mean(y2), sd(y1), sd(y2), n1, n2) } twoSampleMean(100, 100, 5, 10, 1, 1, plot = T) ## [1] 5.00070 9.90999 1.04483 0.92494 100.00000 100.00000 repVals &lt;- replicate(10000, twoSampleMean(100, 100, 5, 10, 1, 1)) "],

In other words, the outcome measured was continuous. However, many times our variable of interest is categorical and requires a different method. 10.1 One Sample Proportions For example, if researchers were interested in investigating the proportion of college students who binge drink, the researchers could ask a sample of students if they had engaged in binge drinking in the past month, and the students would answer yes or no. If the investigators had asked how many drinks they had had in the past month, then we might be interested in looking at the mean number of drinks. But, let‚Äôs say they did not ask this question, and we have a categorical outcome. When we have a sample, and each person is asked a yes or no question, we can describe the probability of their responses using a binomial distribution. In binomial distribution, there are two parameters, the sample size and the probability of an event occurring. Since the researchers are interested in proportion, they are actually interested in estimating the event probability. 10.2 Two Sample Proportions 10.3 Contingency Based tests 10.4 Paired Categorical Data "],
