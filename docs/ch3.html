<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Importance of Study Design</h2>
<p>In chapter 1, we defined statistics by its ability to quantify our uncertainty
about a potential outcome, e.g. the effectiveness of a drug. In order for us to
effectively do this and make accurate inference, we must remove other sources of
uncertainty. This is accomplished via high-quality study design and execution.
Despite statisticians best efforts, fancy statistical methods cannot save a poorly
designed study. However, a well-designed study can make the statistics much simpler
and put researchers in the best position to answer their research questions and
advance science.</p>
<p>As a critical piece of the statistical framework, <strong>study design</strong> is the process that
allows us to collect data on the best sample from the population to achieve our research goals.
There are many types of study designs with various strengths and limitations.
The entirety of the science of study design couldn’t possible be covered in a
single chapter of an introductory statistics textbook; instead we will focus on
some of the main considerations when designing a study, as well as the common
ways study design can go wrong and the statistical implications.</p>

Figure 3.1: Statistical Framework
</p>
</div>
<p>In an ideal world, the study design process might look a little bit like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We start with a list of everyone in our population of interest.</li>
<li>Each person in this population is equally easy to sample, and the cost of sampling everyone is the same</li>
<li>We use our list to randomly select a proportion of individuals in the population who will participate in our study</li>
<li>Everybody sampled is eager to help us with our study, and nobody refuses to participate</li>
<li>The outcome of interest can be accurately measured on each subject and directly answers the research question.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, things are rarely perfect, and this can lead to what we call <strong>bias</strong>.
In our day to day life, we think about bias as some type of prejudice in favor or
against a person or group. For example, if you are given two identical cupcakes
and are told that one was made by a professional chef and the other was not, you
may think that one cupcake tastes much better than the other one. Scientific or
research bias is not all that different. We define scientific bias as the process
or technique whereby the estimated outcome is systematically different from the
true value it is intended to estimate. As an over-the-top example, imagine you
were trying to estimate the percent of voters that will support the Democrat
party in the next election. If you only asked voters who are registered
Democrats, you would most certainly overestimate the actual percent you are
interested in.</p>
<p>Bias can occur at various points during a research study and materialize
in many forms. The ability to identify bias is a crucial skill for researchers
to have when designing their own studies, as well as evaluating the merit of
other studies in the literature. In this chapter, we focus on defining several
common types of bias, how each type can impact study results, and how they can
be avoided. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list - if you are interested in
learning about other types of bias, check out the <a href="https://catalogofbias.org/biases/">Catalogue of Biases</a>. We will categorize different types
of bias broadly by when they occur: pre-trial, during trial, and
post-trial, although all types of bias should be considered when planning
a study.</p>

<div id="ch3_s2_ss1" class="section level3" number="3.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Selection Bias</h3>
<p>The first major consideration when planning a study is who you will ask
to participate. When selecting your sample, you must ensure the sample is
representative of the population of interest. Otherwise, your study may be prone to
<strong>selection bias</strong>, where the study participants differ systematically from the
population of interest. For example, in the first phase of a vaccine
trial, the vaccine is often given to young, healthy volunteers to assess its safety
profile. However, the vaccine is intended for use for both young and older people,
as well as those that may have underlying medical conditions. If the safety of
the vaccine was only determined based on the initial studies in healthy
participants, it would look safer than it really is. This is why these initial
studies are primarily used to stop development of a vaccine that is unsafe.
Vaccines that are found to be safe in healthy people proceed to further
testing in the general population to accurately determine the safety profile.
Selection bias can be avoided by careful consideration of the make up of the
population and a sampling method that accounts for various sub-populations that
may differ in respect to the study outcome.</p>

<div id="ch3_s2_ss2" class="section level3" number="3.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Confirmation Bias/Placebo Effect</h3>
<p>I hate this.</p>
<p>To determine if a new treatment is effective, it must be compared to something
else. This is addressed by splitting the sample into two groups: the
<strong>treatment group</strong> and the <strong>control group</strong>. Subjects in the treatment group
are given the vaccine, whereas subjects in the control group are not treated
and are used for comparison. Subjects must be assigned to receive the treatment
or control at random to avoid selection bias. In addition, there is the potential
for bias to arise if the subjects know whether or not they’re being treated. This
is known as <strong>confirmation bias</strong>, where the knowledge of treatment allocation
can make study participants perceive the treatment benefit differently. To
avoid this and ensure that any differences in the outcome are due to the treatment,
researchers use a <strong>placebo</strong>, or fake treatment (e.g. a sugar pill
or saline infection).</p>
<p>through what is called the <strong>placebo effect</strong>. The placebo effect</p>
<p>Blinding is used to address or control for the placebo effect.</p>

<div id="ch3_s2_ss3" class="section level3" number="3.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Observer Bias</h3>
<p>Researchers often have expectations about how effective their treatment is
(otherwise they probably wouldn’t be studying it). If the researcher is also
responsible for recording subjective assessments of the study participants, there
is the potential for their beliefs about the treatment to influence</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Non-response/Participant Bias</h3>
<p>We remarked earlier that in an ideal world, all selected participants would be
eager to participate in our study. However, this is not always the case. To make
matters even more difficult, sometimes those that want to participate in our
study differ in meaningful ways from those that do participate. This is called<br />
<strong>non-response or participant bias</strong>. This type of bias can occur in many studies,
but is often a particular concern for studies that send out surveys or election
polls. For example, consider the end-of-semester teaching evaluations that provide
students an opportunity to review their instructor anonymously. When students
are not required to fill out these evaluations, its likely that only students
with strong opinions about their instructor will take the time to respond. This
may cause the final evaluations to be a mix of very negative ratings and very
positive ratings, when the instructors performance is actually somewhere in the
middle. Participant bias can be avoided when designing a study by reducing the
survey length and offering incentives for participation. During a study,</p>

<div id="ch3_s3_ss2" class="section level3" number="3.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Compliance Bias</h3>
<p>Despite individuals being willing to participate in a research study, this does
not always mean they will comply perfectly with their assigned treatment.
Consider an exercise study designed to help people lose weight. Individuals that
are heavier and out of shape may tend to skip some of the workouts or drop out
of the study at a higher rate than individuals that are in better shape prior
to starting the study. Since compliance is directly tied to the outcome of interest
(weight loss), bias may occur causing the exercise plan to look less effective
than it truly is. Bias due to compliant participants differing from non-compliant
participants is called <strong>compliance bias</strong>. Consider a 1980 study of the drug
clofibrate, which is designed to reduce blood cholesterol levels to prevent
coronary heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to take up to three
capsules of either clofibrate or placebo three times per day. At follow-up
visits, the remaining number of capsules were counted to estimate how many each
participant actually took each day. When comparing those that adhered (took at
least 80% of their required capsules) to those that did not the study results were:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>When comparing adherers and non-adherers in the clofibrate group, we see that
non-adherers were much more likely to die. This seems to provide strong evidence
that clofibrate is effective, however we have ignored the results of the patients
in the placebo group.</p>

<p>When comparing patients in the clofibrate group to those that were on the placebo,
we see the same trend of reduced mortality in adherers. Additionally, the death
rate for adherers taking clofibrate is exactly the same as that for patients
taking the placebo. This would indicate that clofibrate is not the reason for
reduced mortality, and instead it is driven by characteristics of those that
adhere to their medication. One possibility is that adherers are more concerned
with their health in general, and are thus more likely to take better care of
themselves. Compliance bias can be avoided by comparing subjects only by the
groups they were randomized to, despite their adherence to the treatment. This
is also called <strong>intent to treat analysis</strong>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Confounding</h3>
<p>When it is not possible to conduct a randomized controlled double-blind trial,</p>
<p>A <em>confounder</em>, also known as a <em>lurking variable</em>, is a third variable which is
related to both exposure and outcome. Because of this relationship, confounders distort the observed relationship between exposure and outcome.</p>
<p>Many epidemiologic studies have shown that coffee drinkers have an increased
risk of lung cancer. However, researchers also noticed that smokers are more
likely to drink coffee</p>

<p>Once researchers <em>controlled</em> for smoking status, they no longer found a change
in lung cancer risk due to <a href="https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/25/6/951">drinking coffee</a></p>
<p>Confounding can be avoided when designing the study by ensuring the treatment
and control groups have similar distributions of each confounding variable. In
the coffee and cancer example, this would be analagous to ensuring there were
similar proportions of smokers in the coffee drinking and non-coffee drinking
groups. If it is not possible to control for a confounder when designing the
study, there are many analysis methods (beyond the scope of this course) that
can be used.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Extrapolation Bias</h3>
<p>The previous two examples demonstrated ways in which we might incorrectly move from a target population to a non-representative sample. This final case describes movement in the opposite direction: from a specified sample to a more general population. Nonetheless, the cause of the bias is the same.</p>
<p>The motivation here can be most readily illustrated by considering the issue of pharmaceutical trails and the use of children. For practical, ethical, and economic reasons, clinical trials usually only involve adults - indeed, only about 25% of drugs are subjected to pediatric studies. Physicians, however, are allowed to use any FDA-approved drug in any way that they think is beneficial are are not required to inform parents if the therapy has not been tested on children.</p>
