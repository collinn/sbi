<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction to Data</h2>
<p>Data can be virtually anything that is observed and recorded, including how
tall you are, the color of all the cars in a town, or the time it takes to drive to work.
Just as the different types of data can vary considerably, so can the amount.
There is a natural tension between the quantity of data available and our
abilities to make sense of it. It is difficult to sort through large streams of
data and make any meaningful conclusions. Instead, we can better understand data
by condensing it into human readable mediums through the use of <em>data summaries</em>,
often displayed in the forms of <em>tables</em> and <em>figures</em>. However, in doing so,
information is often be lost in the process. A good data summary will seek to
strike a balance between clarity and completeness of information. The focus of
this chapter will be on descriptive statistics, utilizing both numerical and
graphical summaries of various types of data.</p>
<p>The optimal summary and presentation of data depends on the data’s type. There
are two broad types of data that we may see in the wild, which we will call
<strong>categorical data</strong> and <strong>continuous data</strong>. As the name suggests, categorical data
(sometimes called <em>qualitative</em> or <em>discrete</em> data) are data that fall into
distinct categories. Categorical data can further be classified into two distinct types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nominal data</strong>: data that exists without any sort of natural or apparent ordering,
e.g., colors (red, green, blue), gender (male, female), and type of motor vehicle (car, truck, SUV).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Ordinal data</strong>: data that does have a natural ordering, e.g., education
(high school, some college, college) and injury severity (low, medium, high)</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuous data (sometimes called <em>quantitative</em> data), on the other hand, are
data that can take on any numeric value on some interval or on a continuum.
Examples of continuous data include height, weight, and temperature. Categorical
and continuous data are summarized differently, and we’ll explore a number of
ways to summarize both types of data.</p>

<p>Let’s begin by considering a dataset of survey responses for 592 students
responding with their sex, hair color, and eye color. This data includes
responses from male and female students, with hair colors that are black, brown,
red, or blond, and eyes that are brown, blue, hazel, or green. Note that these
are <em>qualitative</em> measures, suggesting that are dealing with categorical data.
Let’s take a look at the data for the first ten subjects.</p>

<p>Each row indicates a subject possessing the indicated sex, hair, and eye color.
For example, the first row indicates a male with brown hair and blue eyes. Trying
to make sense of 592 such observations is a daunting task, so we can begin by
taking the data we have and summarizing it in a useful way. For categorical data,
like we have here, summarizing the data is pretty straightforward – you just
count how many times each category occurs. For example, we can count how many
of each hair color was observed in our data.</p>

<p>This kind of counting is known as <strong>absolute frequency</strong>, which gives us a single
value indicating the total number of observations. In looking at the table above,
it is clear that there are far more observations with brown hair than black,
blond, and red.</p>
<p>However, suppose somebody asks you how common brown hair is <em>relative</em> to other
colors. Does it make sense to respond, “Oh, there are 286 individuals with
brown hair?” Without knowing the values for the other hair colors, this number
alone doesn’t carry much meaning. Is 286 observations a lot? It depends. Were
300 people examined? 3,000? Without knowing anything about the rest of the data,
the absolute frequency may not be very useful.</p>
<p>In addition to actual counts of observations in categorical data, we may often
be interested in <strong>rates</strong>. A rate can be as simple as taking the total number
of a single category observed, and stating it in terms of the total number of
observations. For example, instead of saying, “286 subjects who were
observed had brown hair,” we might instead say, “286 of 592 subjects surveyed
had brown hair.” Rates are also known as <strong>relative frequencies</strong>, because
they are relative to a specific number of observations. More commonly, we use
<strong>percentages</strong>, also known as <strong>proportions</strong>, which are a special type of rate or
relative frequency – the count per 100 observations. That is, 286 of 592 subjects becomes
<span class="math inline">\(286/592 = 0.4831 = 48.31\%\)</span>. Let’s consider again the same table as above, this time
in terms of percentages:</p>

<p>By considering all observations as rates per one hundred, we can quickly compare
the relative counts of our observations. For example, we can quickly note that
about half of the observations collected had brown hair, and almost twice as many
had blond hair compared to red.</p>
<p>In addition to tables, we can also summarize categorical data visually. The most
common figure used to represent categorical data is the <strong>bar plot</strong>. Below is a
demonstration of a bar plot for the percentages of hair color in our data.</p>

<p>Numerical and visual summaries become even more useful as our data becomes more
complicated. Let’s continue with the data we’ve been using, but now let us also
break down observations with each hair color by sex as well. This process is
known as <strong>stratification</strong>.</p>

<p>First, we notice that by taking sums across the columns, we arrive at the same
numbers that we had when only hair color was considered. If we sum horizontally across the rows, we also get the total number of observations of each sex. Note
that the sum of both marginal totals add up to 592, the total number of observations. In other words, when stratifying the hair
color counts by sex, we haven’t lost any information related to the hair color,
but we have <em>added information</em> to our summary about sex.</p>
<p>Getting stratified counts is straightforward; however, we now have several ways
in which we might compute the percentages. For the table above, there are three
ways we could compute percents.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many in each category, relative to the entire sample</li>

<p>Now our table looks very different. The percentages in the inner cells to not add up to 100%. Instead, the percentages have been computed relative to the total number of respondents in each sex. For example, we still have 56 male subjects with black hair, but relative to the total number of male subjects (279), this is 56/279 = 0.201 = 20.1%. There are 52 black-haired female respondents out of 313 total females, which gives us 53/313 = 0.166 = 16.6%. Since the percentages are computed relative to sex, we now see the percentages in <em>each column</em> add up to 100%. In other words, we have information about distribution of hair colors within sex.</p>

<p>Similarly, we can also look at the relative frequencies of each sex within the
four hair color categories. We have 56 black-haired males and 52 black-haired
females, so 56/108 = 0.519 = 51.9% of the black-haired respondents are male and
53/108 = 0.481 = 48.1% are female. Since hair color is given in the rows of our
table, we now have percentages that add up to 100% in each <em>row</em>.</p>
<p>All three of these tables are correct and informative. When deciding the best
way to calculate percentages for tables like this, it will depend on the
research question and the data at hand. We can also use stratification graphically,
by creating multiple bar plots for each category of the stratification variable.</p>

<p>This data contains continuous measurements on the air quality:</p>
<ul>
<li>maximum daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at La Guardia Airport (Temp)<br />
</li>
<li>average wind speed in miles per hour (mph) at La Guardia Airport (Wind)</li>
<li>average ozone in parts per billion (ppb) from 1:00pm - 3:00pm at Roosevelt Island (Ozone)</li>
</ul>
<p>The tables and bar charts we introduced in <a href="ch2.html#ch2_s2">Section 2</a> are great summaries when
the data can be categorized and counted. With continuous data, however, there are no natural discrete categories into which our data can be organized. Instead, one way we can visualize the data is by first
creating <em>bins</em> which partition an interval of possible values and then counting the
number of observations that fall into each bin. For example, when considering a range of temperature values from 50°F - 100°F, we might construct bins at intervals of 5°F. Plotting the absolute or relative
frequency of observations in each bin gives us a <strong>histogram</strong>. Below is an example of a histogram representing the maximum daily temperatures from our New York data:</p>
<p><img src="introTextbookTemplate_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In the histogram of temperature, we can readily see that on most days between May and
September, the maximum temperature at La Guardia was between 75°F - 85°F. Some
days were particularly chilly, with temperatures below 60°F and some days
were quite hot, with temperatures above 90°F.</p>
<!-- [[This isn't really necessary since students aren't making histograms]] -->
<!-- When creating a histogram, -->
<!-- it is important to be careful in selecting the size of each bin. Bins that are  -->
<!-- too large can over-simplify the data, but bins that are too small can make the  -->
<!-- figure unnecessarily complex.  -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) -->
<!-- hist(aq$Temp, main = 'Too few bins', -->
<!--      xlab = 'Temperature (degrees F)', ylab = 'Count', -->
<!--      col = 'salmon1', breaks = 2) -->
<!-- hist(aq$Temp, main = 'Too many bins', -->
<!--      xlab = 'Temperature (degrees F)', ylab = 'Count', -->
<!--      col = 'salmon1', breaks = 150) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<p>Histograms also provide a nice picture of the <em>distribution</em>, or “shape,” of the observed data. Distributions of data can look very different for different sets of data, and we will consider them in more detail in <a href="ch6.html#ch6">Chapter 6</a>. For now, its only relevant to know that distributions of data are often summarized with two types of measures – those that describe where the centers (peaks) of our data are and those that describe how spread out the data is about that peak. As these will be important concepts for the rest of this book, let’s take a moment now to go into a bit more detail into each.</p>
<div id="ch3_centrality" class="section level3" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Measures of Centrality</h3>
<p>While nothing can replace a picture, sometimes it is preferable to summarize our data with one or two numbers characterizing the most important information about the distribution. Often, we are most interested in information that describes the ‘center’ of a distribution, where the bulk of our data tends to aggregate. The two most common ways to describe the center are with the <em>mean</em> and the <em>median</em>.</p>
<!-- Histograms can come in a variety of shapes and are often described by the number -->
<!-- of peaks shown and by their *skewness*. In -->
<!-- our temperature histogram, we see only one peak, so we call the distribution  -->
<!-- **unimodal**. When there are two peaks, we say the distribution is **bimodal**,  -->
<!-- and for any number of peaks of three or more, we call the histogram **multimodal**. -->
<!-- Looking at the histogram of temperature, we also see that the observed temperatures -->
<!-- are fairly evenly distributed around the peak. When a histogram has equal tails on -->
<!-- both sides of the peak, it is considered to be **symmetric**. Otherwise, the  -->
<!-- histogram is considered to be skewed. We can further describe the skew by the side -->
<!-- of the histogram with a longer tail - if there is a large tail to the right of the  -->
<!-- histogram we call it **skewed right** and if there is a large tail to the left of -->
<!-- the histogram we call it **skewed left**. Let's look at a few different histogram -->
<!-- shapes to illustrate these definitions. -->
<!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width = 7} -->
<!-- set.seed(2) -->
<!-- x1 <- rbeta(10000,5,5) -->

<!-- x3 <- rbeta(10000,5,2) -->
<!-- bimodal <- c(rtruncnorm(7500, a=0, b=1, mean=.2, sd=.1), -->
<!--                  rtruncnorm(4000, a=0, b=1, mean=.75, sd=.1)) -->
<!-- histCol <- 'plum1' -->
<!-- par(mfrow= c(2, 2)) -->
<!-- hist(x1, col = histCol,  -->

<!-- While nothing can replace a picture, sometimes it is preferable to summarize our -->
<!-- data with one or two numbers which characterize the most important information  -->
<!-- about the distribution. Often, we are most interested in the location of the -->
<!-- peak (center) and how spread out the data is around that peak. There are two  -->
<!-- popular methods to describe the center of a distribution: -->
<!-- - Mean -->
<!-- - Median -->
<p>The <strong>mean</strong> is the most commonly used measure of the center of a distribution.
Simply enough, the mean is found by taking the sum of all of the observations,
and dividing by the total. With <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations, <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)</span>,
we can mathematically express the mean, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> (x-bar), in the following way:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n} = \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
\]</span>
The <strong>median</strong> is another common measure of the center of a distribution. In
particular, for a set of observations, the median is an observed value that is
both larger than half of the observations, as well as smaller than half of the
observations. In other words, if we were to line our data up from smallest to largest, the median value would be right in the middle. Indeed, to find the median, we begin by
arranging our data from smallest to largest. If the total number of observations,
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, is odd, then the median is simply the middle observation; if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even,
it is the average of the middle two.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1, 2, 2, 3, {\color{red} 5}, 7, 9, 10, 11 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Median} = 5\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1,2,2,3, {\color{red} 5}, {\color{red} 6}, 7, 9, 10, 11, \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Median} = \frac{(5+6)}{2} = 5.5\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For the New York temperature data, the mean is 77.9°F and
the median is 79°F. These values are very similar to
each other, and both fall near the peak in the histogram.</p>
<p><img src="introTextbookTemplate_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>However, it is not always the case that the mean and median will be similar. Let’s
consider an example in Table 2.4 where we collect <span class="math inline">\(n = 10\)</span> samples of salaries for University
of Iowa employees:</p>
<table class="table" style="width: auto !important; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">

<p>For our sample, we find that the mean is $569,266, but the median is
($48,962 + $50,879) / 2 = $49,921. It turns out our sample included the highest
paid university employee – the head football coach. This extremely high salary
has caused the mean to be very large – larger than the remaining 90% of the salaries in our
sample <em>combined</em>. The median, on the other hand, ignoring the extremes ends of our distribution and focusing on the middle, is not impacted by the football coach’s
salary. Consequently, in this case, it is a much better reflection of the typically university employee’s
salary than the estimate found with the mean.</p>
<p>This one high salary, which is not representative of most of the salaries
collected, is known as an <strong>outlier</strong>. From the example above, we have seen that
the mean is highly sensitive to the presence of outliers while the median is not.
Measures that are less sensitive to outliers are called <strong>robust</strong> measures. The median is a robust estimator of the center of the data.</p>
<p>We have seen an example where the mean and median are quite close and an example
where they are wildly different. This begs the broader question – when might we
expect these measures of central tendency to be the same, and when might we expect
them to differ? Here, we consider a collection of histograms showing us different “shapes” that the distributions of our data may take.</p>

The modality of a distribution is a statement about its modes, or “peaks.” Distributions with a single peak are called <em>unimodal</em>, whereas distributions with two peaks are call <em>bimodal</em>. <em>Multimodal</em> distributions are those with three or more peaks. The skew on the other hand describes how our data relates to those peaks. Distributions in which the data is dispersed evenly on either side of a peak are called <em>symmetric distributions</em>; otherwise, the distribution is considered skewed. The direction of the skew is towards the side in which the tail is longest. Examples of modality and skew are presented in Figure 2.1.</p>
<p>When the data is unimodal and symmetric, the mean and median are indistinguishable.
However, when there is skew or multiple peaks, we see the mean and median start
to differ. When the distribution is skewed, the mean is pulled towards the tail.
On the other hand, the number of very large/small observations is relatively small,
so the median remains closer to the peak where the majority of data lies. When
the distribution is bimodal, neither the mean or median can summarize the distribution
well. In that case, it might be better to characterize the center of each peak individually.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Measures of Dispersion</h3>
<p>In addition to measuring the center of the distribution, we are also interested
in the <em>spread</em> or <em>dispersion</em> of the data. Two distributions could have the
same mean or median without necessarily having the same shape.
For example, consider the two distributions of data shown below. Each distribution
represents a sample of 1,000 observations with mean of 100.</p>
<p><img src="introTextbookTemplate_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Despite the mean values of each of these distributions being the same, we can clearly see that they are different. On the left, we see that nearly the entire range of the observed data falls between 50 and 150. For the distribution on the right, the data is much more spread out, taking on values near 0 and 200. In order to accurately capture these differences, we need a second numerical summary describing the degree to which the data is spread about its center. Here, we consider two broad categories – those based on percentiles and those based on the variance.</p>
<div id="percentiles-and-iqr" class="section level4" number="2.3.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2.1</span> Percentiles and IQR</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most intuitive methods of describing the dispersion of our data are those associated with <strong>percentile</strong>-based summaries. Formally, the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>th percentile is some value <span class="math inline">\(V_p\)</span> such that</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math inline">\(p\%\)</span> of observations are less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(V_p\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\((100 - p)\%\)</span> of observations are greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(V_p\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Informally, percentiles quantify where observations fall, relative to all of the other observations in the data. Two of the best known percentiles are the <span class="math inline">\(1^{st}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(99^{th}\)</span> percentiles, more commonly referred to as the minimum and maximum values. Together, these two numbers describe the <strong>range</strong> of our data. The next most common value is the <span class="math inline">\(50^{th}\)</span> percentile – the median – which we recall describes the value for which half of our observations and greater (or lesser) than. We are also often interested in determining the <span class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(75^{th}\)</span> as well, which, respectively, mark the midpoints between the minimum and the median and the median and the maximum. Along with the median, these three percentiles make up the <em>quartiles</em> of our data, denoted</p>
<!-- The variance and standard deviation measure the spread of the data around the mean. -->
<!-- Therefore, these summaries should only be used when the mean is chosen to reflect the data. -->
<!-- We learned previously that the mean is a good measure of the center of data that  -->
<!-- has a unimodal and symmetric distribution, but when the distribution is skewed,  -->
<!-- the median is more accurate. In general, when data is skewed and not accurately -->
<!-- summarized with the mean and standard deviation, we often turn to  -->
<!-- **percentile**-based summaries. Formally, the $p$th percentile is a value $V_p$ such that -->
<!-- - $p\%$ of observations are below $V_p$ -->
<!-- - $(100 - p)\%$ of observations are greater than $V_p$ -->
<!-- More informally, percentiles quantify where observations fall, relative to all  -->
<!-- the other observations in the data.  -->
<!-- Suppose, that we are looking for the $20$th percentile of the (already sorted) -->
<!-- sample below. The 20th percentile will be the number such that it is greater  -->
<!-- than or equal to 20% of the data, but smaller than the remaining 80%.  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- 2,\ 3,\ 5,\ 5\ ,\ 6 ,\ 7,\ 10,\ 23,\ 26,\ 28. -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- For this sample of 10 observations, the $20$th percentile would be 3, as 20% of  -->
<!-- the observations $\{2, \ 3\}$ are less than or equal to it, while the remaining  -->
<!-- 80%, $\{5,\ 5\ ,\ 6 ,\ 7,\ 10,\ 23,\ 26,\ 28 \}$ are greater than it.  -->
<!-- As you can imagine, this definition can get a little complicated when we have  -->
<!-- small sample sizes or tied values. With 10 observations, it is straightforward to -->
<!-- discuss percentiles that are multiples of 10 (e.g., 10th, 20th, etc.), but what  -->
<!-- about the 28th percentile? Additionally, in our sample there are two observations -->
<!-- with the value 5. Does this mean 5 is the 30th percentile or the 40th? There are -->
<!-- a number of different methods for defining and calculating percentiles in these  -->
<!-- more complicated cases, but for the intent of this book, we will focus more on  -->
<!-- the conceptual interpretation of the percentile, rather than it's precise definition.  -->
<!-- There are a number of specific percentiles that are especially useful to us. -->
<!-- For example, we have already seen the median, which can also be referred to as  -->
<!-- the $50$th percentile of a dataset. In addition to the median, we are also often -->
<!-- interested in determining the $25$th and $75$th percentile as well. These three  -->
<!-- percentiles make up the *quartiles* of the data, denoted -->
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
Q_1 &amp;= 25^{th} \text{ percentile} = 1^{st} \text{ or lower quartile} \\
Q_2 &amp;= 50^{th} \text{ percentile} = 2^{nd} \text{quartile or median} \\
Q_3 &amp;= 75^{th} \text{ percentile} = 3^{rd} \text{ or upper quartile}
\end{align*}
\]</span>
We know the median, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, is the value such that 50% of observations are less than
the median and 50% are greater than it. <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> can be said to represent the median of the
smaller 50% of all observations, while <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span> can be said to be the median of
larger 50%. In other words, 25% of the data is below <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span>, 25% of the data is
between <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, 25% of the data is between <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>, and the
remaining 25% of the data is larger than <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>.</p>
<p>A commonly used percentile-based measure of spread combining these measures is the <strong>interquartile range (IQR)</strong>, defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{IRQ} = Q_3 - Q_1.\]</span></p>
<p>Because it is the difference between the upper and lower quartile, it represents
the distance covering the middle 50% of the data. We may also report the range
as an interval as <span class="math inline">\((Q_1, Q_3)\)</span>. For the New York temperature data, <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 = 72\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q_3 = 85\)</span>. The IQR is therefore <span class="math inline">\(85 - 72 = 13\)</span> and tells us that 50% of the days
between May and September had temperatures between 72°F and 85°F.</p>
<p><img src="introTextbookTemplate_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The IQR is not impacted by the presence of outliers, so it is considered a robust
measure of the spread of the data. So, like the median, it enjoys the quality of being a robust measure of the data.</p>
<!-- [[This paragraph was moved to the var/sd section]] -->
<!-- The IQR is not impacted by the presence of outliers, so it is considered a robust -->
<!-- measure of the spread of the data. As mentioned previously, the standard deviation -->
<!-- is based on the mean. Since the mean is not a robust summary, neither is the  -->
<!-- standard deviation. This tells us that for unimodal and symmetric data, the choice -->
<!-- between the mean/standard deviation and the median/IQR is only a matter of personal -->
<!-- preference. However, when the data is skewed or has large outliers, robust summaries -->
<!-- are preferred, meaning that the median/IQR will be a better representation of the data. -->
<p>Percentiles are also used to create another common visual representation of
continuous data: the <strong>boxplot</strong>, also known as a <strong>box-and-whisker plot</strong>. A
boxplot consist of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A box, indicating the Interquartile Range (IQR), bounded by the values <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span></li>
<li>The median, or <span class="math inline">\(Q_2\)</span>, represented by the line drawn within the box</li>
<li>The “whiskers,” extending out of the box, which can be defined in a number of
ways. Commonly, the whiskers are 1.5 times the length of the IQR from either
<span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span></li>
<li>Outliers, presented as small circles or dots, and are values in the data that are not present within the bounds set by either the box or whiskers</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="introTextbookTemplate_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="720" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Just like histograms, boxplots can also illustrate the skew of a data. In a
histogram, the skewed was named after the location of the tail and in a boxplot,
this corresponds to the side with a longer whisker. Here we can see histograms
and boxplots for various distributions of data.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2.2</span> Variance and Standard Deviation</h4>
<p>The <strong>variance</strong> and the <strong>standard deviation</strong> are numerical summaries which
quantify how spread out the distribution is around its mean. This is done by
calculating how far away each observation is from the mean, squaring that difference,
and then taking an average over all observations. For a sample of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observations
<span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)</span>, the variance, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>, is calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2.
\]</span></p>
<p>The standard deviation, denoted <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, is a function of the variance.
Specifically, it is the square root of the variance <span class="math inline">\(s = \sqrt{s^2}\)</span>. Because the
variance uses the squared differences between each observation and the mean, its
units are the square of the units of the original data. For example, the
New York temperature measurements have a mean of 77.9°F and a variance
of 89.6°F<sup>2</sup>, a value that does not readily lend itself to interpretation. The standard deviation, on the other hand, takes the square root, putting
the units back on the original scale. For the temperature data, the standard
deviation is 9.5°F. Because of this, the standard deviation is often
preferred as a measure of spread over the variance.</p>
<p>Finally, unlike the median and the IQR, which are based the percentiles of the observed data, both the variance and standard deviation are calculated based on the mean. Recall that the mean is <em>not</em> a robust outlier and is highly sensitive to skew or the presence of outliers. Consequently, the variance and the standard deviation are also very sensitive. When the data are unimodal and symmetric, choosing between the mean/standard deviation and the median/IQR is largely a matter of preference. However, when the data is skewed or has large outliers, more robust statistics such as the median and IQR are preferred.</p>

<p>One thing we might be interested in is the distribution of temperatures in each
month. Month can be considered an ordinal categorical variable, and temperature
is continuous. When we want to see the distribution of a continuous variable
across multiple categories, we can look at side-by-side boxplots.</p>
<p><img src="introTextbookTemplate_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>By putting all of the boxplots next to each other with the same temperature range,
we can quickly detect trends and differences in temperature in the five months.
Median temperature peaks in July/August and is lowest in May. Temperatures in
May and September are more variable, whereas the range of temperatures in July is
less spread out. There is some overlap between all of these boxplots, which means
that although July and August have higher temperatures more often, there are days
in the other months that are just as hot or days in July that are cooler.</p>
<p>Now let’s consider the case in which we have two continuous variables. Suppose, for example, that we are interested in both temperature and ozone levels, as well as the relationship between the two of them. We might first consider them separately; presented below is a visualization of the distribution of both temperature and ozone levels in the New York air quality data:</p>
<p><img src="introTextbookTemplate_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>While temperature is unimodal and symmetric in distribution, the ozone concentration
measurements are skewed right. These plots are useful in studying each of these variables individually, but they do not provide any
information about the relationship between temperature and ozone concentration,
which we may expect to be related.</p>
<p>To look at the relationship between two continuous variables, a common
visualization is the <strong>scatter plot</strong>. A scatter
plot is a two-dimensional plot of data pairs, with one variable represented on the
x-axis, the horizontal range of the plot, and the other variable on the y-axis, or the vertical range. Each dot
on a scatter plot represents a single observation. In the plot below, we have put
the mean ozone on the x-axis and temperature on the y-axis, with each dot representing
one day between May and September. For example, on August 25th, the maximum
temperature was 81°F, and the mean ozone concentration was 168ppm. For illustration, this
day is colored red on the scatter plot.</p>
<p><img src="introTextbookTemplate_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Plotted together, the relationship between ozone concentration and temperature becomes apparent – lower temperatures tend to be associated with lower ozone concentrations while higher temperatures are associated with higher ozone levels. The scatter plot is able to illustrate an important relationship that wouldn’t be
detectable just by looking at histograms of each variable separately.</p>
<p>We may further describe our data by including a third categorical variable. In our
scatter plot of ozone and temperature, we could also color the points by the month
on which they occurred.</p>
<p><img src="introTextbookTemplate_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>After coloring the points by month, we can see some clusters forming as temperature
and ozone concentration on days closer together are more likely to be similar. By
adding information about a third variable, we are able to illustrate more information
about our data in one figure.</p>
<p>Numerical summaries and graphical visualizations provide us with tools to<br />
capture important features of our data. Understanding the distribution and skew
of a variable help us know the best way to summarize it numerically. Summaries and
figures can become increasingly complex as they incorporate more variables, but
these illustrations can be informative for answering and producing important research
questions and hypotheses.</p>
